Section III: Reading Comprehension
Each of the two passages below is followed by five questions. For each question there are 

four answers. Read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the 

questions. Put your choice in the brackets on the left. (10 points)
Text 1
There are a great many careers in which the increasing emphasis is on specialization. You 

find these careers in engineering, in production, in statistical work, and in teaching. 

But there is an increasing demand for people who are able to take in great area at a 

glance, people who perhaps do not know too much about any one field. There is, in other 

words, a demand for people who are capable of seeing the forest rather than the trees, of 

making general judgments. We can call these people ¡°generalists.¡± And these 

¡°generalists¡± are particularly needed for positions in administration, where it is their 

job to see that other people do the work, where they have to plan for other people, to 

organize other people¡¯s work, to begin it and judge it.
The specialist understands one field; his concern is with technique and tools. He is a 

¡°trained¡± man; and his educational background is properly technical or professional. The 

generalist -- and especially the administrator -- deals with people; his concern is with 

leadership, with planning, and with direction giving. He is an ¡°educated¡± man; and the 

humanities are his strongest foundation. Very rarely is a specialist capable of being an 

administrator. And very rarely is a good generalist also a good specialist in particular 

field. Any organization needs both kinds of people, though different organizations need 

them in different proportions. It is your task to find out, during your training period, 

into which of the two kinds of jobs you fit, and to plan your career accordingly.
Your first job may turn out to be the right job for you -- but this is pure accident. 

Certainly you should not change jobs constantly or people will become suspicious of your 

ability to hold any job. At the same time you must not look upon the first job as the 

final job; it is primarily a training job, an opportunity to understand yourself and your 

fitness for being an employee.
26.	There is an increasing demand for ________.
[A] all round people in their own fields
[B] people whose job is to organize other people¡¯s work
[C] generalists whose educational background is either technical or professional
[D] specialists whose chief concern is to provide administrative guidance to others
27.	The specialist is ________.
[A] a man whose job is to train other people
[B] a man who has been trained in more than one fields
[C] a man who can see the forest rather than the trees
[D] a man whose concern is mainly with technical or professional matters
28.	The administrator is ________.
[A] a ¡°trained¡± man who is more a specialist than a generalist
[B] a man who sees the trees as well as the forest
[C] a man who is very strong in the humanities
[D] a man who is an ¡°educated¡± specialist
29.	During your training period, it is important ________.
[A] to try to be a generalist
[B] to choose a profitable job
[C] to find an organization which fits you
[D] to decide whether you are fit to be a specialist or a generalist
30.	A man¡¯s first job ________.
[A] is never the right job for him
[B] should not be regarded as his final job
[C] should not be changed or people will become suspicious of his ability to hold any job
[D] is primarily an opportunity to fit himself for his final job
Test 2
At the bottom of the world lies a mighty continent still wrapped in the Ice Age and, until 

recent times, unknown to man. It is a great land mass with mountain ranges whose extent 

and elevation are still uncertain. Much of the continent is a complete blank on our maps. 

Man has explored, on foot, less than one per cent of its area. Antarctica differs 

fundamentally from the Arctic regions. The Arctic is an ocean, covered with drifting 

packed ice and hemmed in by the land masses of Europe, Asia, and North America. The 

Antarctic is a continent almost as large as Europe and Australia combined, centered 

roughly on the South Pole and surrounded by the most unobstructed water areas of the world 

-- the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans.
The continental ice sheet is more than two miles high in its centre, thus, the air over 

the Antarctic is far more refrigerated than it is over the Arctic regions. This cold air 

current from the land is so forceful that it makes the nearby seas the stormiest in the 

world and renders unlivable those regions whose counterparts at the opposite end of the 

globe are inhabited. Thus, more than a million persons live within 2,000 miles of the 

North Pole in an area that includes most of Alaska, Siberia, and Scandinavia -- a region 

rich in forest and mining industries. Apart from a handful of weather stations, within the 

same distance of the South Pole there is not a single tree, industry, or settlement.
31.	The best title for this selection would be ________.
[A] Iceland
[B] Land of Opportunity
[C] The Unknown Continent
[D] Utopia at Last
32.	At the time this article was written, our knowledge of Antarctica was ________.
[A] very limited
[B] vast
[C] fairly rich
[D] nonexistent
33.	Antarctica is bordered by the ________.
[A] Pacific Ocean
[B] Indian Ocean
[C] Atlantic Ocean
[D] All three
34.	The Antarctic is made uninhabitable primarily by ________.
[A] cold air
[B] calm seas
[C] ice
[D] lack of knowledge about the continent
35.	According to this article ________.
[A] 2,000 people live on the Antarctic Continent
[B] a million people live within 2,000 miles of the South Pole
[C] weather conditions within a 2,000 mile radius of the South Pole make settlements 

impractical
[D] only a handful of natives inhabit Antarctica

It would be interesting to discover how many young people go to university without any 

clear idea of what they are going to do afterwards. (71) If one considers the enormous 

variety of courses offered, it is not hard to see how difficult it is for a student to 

select the course most suited to his interests and abilities. (72) If a student goes to 

university to acquire a broader perspective of life, to enlarge his ideas and to learn to 

think for himself, he will undoubtedly benefit. (73) Schools often have too restricting an 

atmosphere, with its time tables and disciplines, to allow him much time for independent 

assessment of the work he is asked to do. (74) Most students would, I believe, profit by a 

year of such exploration of different academic studies, especially those ¡°all rounders¡± 

with no particular interest. They should have longer time to decide in what subject they 

want to take their degrees, so that in later life, they do not look back and say, ¡°I 

should like to have been an archaeologist. If I hadn¡¯t taken a degree in Modern 

Languages, I shouldn¡¯t have ended up as an interpreter, but it¡¯s too late now. I couldn

¡¯t go back and begin all over again.¡±
(75) There is, of course, another side to the question of how to make the best use of one

¡¯s time at university. (76) This is the case of the student who excels in a particular 

branch of learning. (77) He is immediately accepted by the University of his choice, and 

spends his three or four years becoming a specialist, emerging with a first-class Honour 

Degree and very little knowledge of what the rest of the world is all about. (78) It 

therefore becomes more and more important that, if students are not to waste their 

opportunities, there will have to be much more detailed information about courses and more 

advice. Only in this way can we be sure that we are not to have, on the one hand, a band 

of specialists ignorant of anything outside of their own subject, and on the other hand, 

an ever increasing number of graduates qualified in subjects for which there is little or 

no demand in the working world.

question. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (15 points)
Text 1
For centuries men dreamed of achieving vertical flight. In 400 A.D. Chinese children 

played with a fan-like toy that spun upwards and fell back to earth as rotation ceased. 

Leonardo da Vinci conceive the first mechanical apparatus, called a ¡°Helix,¡± which could 

carry man straight up, but was only a design and was never tested.
The ancient-dream was finally realized in 1940 when a Russian engineer piloted a strange 

looking craft of steel tubing with a rotating fan on top. It rose awkwardly and vertically 

into the air from a standing start, hovered a few feet above the ground, went sideways and 

backwards, and then settled back to earth. The vehicle was called a helicopter.
Imaginations were fired. Men dreamed of going to work in their own personal helicopters. 

People anticipate that vertical flight transports would carry millions of passengers as do 

the airliners of today. Such fantastic expectations were not fulfilled.
The helicopter has now become an extremely useful machine. It excels in military missions, 

carrying troops, guns and strategic instruments where other aircraft cannot go. 

Corporations use them as airborne offices, many metropolitan areas use them in police 

work, construction and logging companies employ them in various advantageous ways, 

engineers use them for site selection and surveying, and oil companies use them as the 

best way to make offshore and remote work stations accessible to crews and supplies. Any 

urgent mission to a hard-to-get-to place is a likely task for a helicopter. Among their 

other multitude of used: deliver people across town, fly to and from airports, assist in 

rescue work, and aid in the search for missing or wanted persons.
11.	People expect that ________.
[A] the airliners of today would eventually be replaced by helicopters
[B] helicopters would someday be able to transport large number of people from place to 

place as airliners are now doing
[C] the imaginations fired by the Russian engineer¡¯s invention would become a reality in 

the future
[D] their fantastic expectations about helicopters could be fulfilled by airliners of 

today
12.	Helicopters work with the aid of ________.
[A] a combination of rotating devices in front and on top
[B] a rotating device topside
[C] one rotating fan in the center of the aircraft and others at each end
[D] a rotating fan underneath for lifting
13.	What is said about the development of the helicopter?
[A] Helicopters have only been worked on by man since 1940.
[B] Chinese children were the first to achieve flight in helicopters.
[C] Helicopters were considered more dangerous than the early airplanes.
[D] Some people thought they would become widely used by average individuals.
14.	How has the use of helicopters developed?
[A] They have been widely used for various purposes.
[B] They are taking the place of high-flying jets.
[C] They are used for rescue work.
[D] They are now used exclusively for commercial projects.
15.	Under what conditions are helicopters found to be absolutely essential?
[A] For overseas passenger transportation.
[B] For extremely high altitude flights.
[C] For high-speed transportation.
[D] For urgent mission to places inaccessible to other kinds of craft.
Text 2
In ancient Greece athletic festivals were very important and had strong religious 

associations. The Olympian athletic festival held every four years in honor of Zeus, king 

of the Olympian Gods, eventually lost its local character, became first a national event 

and then, after the rules against foreign competitors had been abolished, international. 

No one knows exactly how far back the Olympic Games go, but some official records date 

from 776 B.C. The games took place in August on the plain by Mount Olympus. Many thousands 

of spectators gathered from all parts of Greece, but no married woman was admitted even as 

a spectator. Slaves, women and dishonored persons were not allowed to compete. The exact 

sequence of events uncertain, but events included boy¡¯s gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, 

horse racing and field events, though there were fewer sports involved than in the modern 

Olympic Games.
On the last day of the Games, all the winners were honored by having a ring of holy olive 

leaves placed on their heads. So great was the honor that the winner of the foot race gave 

his name to the year of his victory. Although Olympic winners received no prize money, 

they were, in fact, richly rewarded by their state authorities. How their results compared 

with modern standards, we unfortunately have no means of telling.
After an uninterrupted history of almost 1,200 years, the Games were suspended by the 

Romans in 394 A.D. They continued for such a long time because people believed in the 

philosophy behind the Olympics: the idea that a healthy body produced a healthy mind, and 

that the spirit of competition in sports and games was preferable to the competition that 

caused wars. It was over 1,500 years before another such international athletic gathering 

took place in Athens in 1896.
Nowadays, the Games are held in different countries in turn. The host country provides 

vast facilities, including a stadium, swimming pools and living accommodation, but 

competing courtiers pay their own athletes¡¯ expenses.
The Olympics start with the arrival in the stadium of a torch, lighted on Mount Olympus by 

the sun¡¯s rays. It is carried by a succession of runners to the stadium. The torch 

symbolized the continuation of the ancient Greek athletic ideals, and it burns throughout 

the Games until the closing ceremony. The well-known Olympic flag, however, is a modern 

conception: the five interlocking rings symbolize the uniting of all five continents 

participating in the Games.

In science the meaning of the word ¡°explain¡± suffers with civilization¡¯s every step in 

search of reality. Science cannot really explain electricity, magnetism, and gravitation; 

their effects can be measured and predicted, but of their nature no more is known to the 

modern scientist than to Thales who first looked into the nature of the electrification of 

amber, a hard yellowish-brown gum. Most contemporary physicists reject the notion that man 

can ever discover what these mysterious forces ¡°really¡± are. ¡°Electricity,¡± Bertrand 

Russell says, ¡°is not a thing, like St. Paul¡¯s Cathedral; it is a way in which things 

behave. When we have told how things behave when they are electrified, and under what 

circumstances they are electrified, we have told all there is to tell.¡± Until recently 

scientists would have disapproved of such an idea. Aristotle, for example, whose natural 

science dominated Western thought for two thousand years, believed that man could arrive 

at an understanding of reality by reasoning from self-evident principles. He felt, for 

example, that it is a self-evident principle that everything in the universe has its 

proper place, hence one can deduce that objects fall to the ground because that¡¯s where 

they belong, and smoke goes up because that¡¯s where it belongs. The goal of Aristotelian 

science was to explain why things happen. Modern science was born when Galileo began 

trying to explain how things happen and thus originated the method of controlled 

experiment which now forms the basis of scientific investigation.
21.	The aim of controlled scientific experiments is ________.
[A] to explain why things happen

[B] in agreement with Aristotle¡¯s theory of self-evident principles
[C] in agreement with scientific investigation directed toward ¡°how¡± things happen
[D] in agreement with scientific investigation directed toward ¡°why¡± things happen
24.	The passage says that until recently scientists disagreed with the idea ________.
[A] that there are mysterious forces in the universe
[B] that man cannot discover what forces ¡°really¡± are

Cheques have __36__ replaced money as a means of exchange for they are widely accepted 

everywhere. Though this is very convenient for both buyer and seller, it should not be 

forgotten that cheques are not real money: they are quite valueless in themselves. A 

shop-keeper always runs a certain __37__ when he accepts a cheques and he is quite __38__ 

his rights if on occasion, he refuses to do so.
People do not always know this and are shocked if their good faith is called __39__. An 

old and very wealthy friend of mine told me he had an extremely unpleasant experience. He 

went to a famous jewelry shop which keeps a large __40__ of precious stones and asked to 

be shown some pearl necklaces. After examining several trays, he decided to buy a 

particularly fine string of pearls and asked if he could pay by Cheques. The assistant 

said that this was quite __41__ but the moment my friend signed his name, he was invited 

into the manager¡¯s office.
The manager was very polite, but he explained that someone with exactly the same name had 

presented them with a worthless Cheque not long ago. My friend got very angry when he 

heard this and said he would buy a necklace somewhere else. When he got up to go, the 

manager told him that the police would arrive at any moment and he had better stay __42__ 

the wanted to get into serious trouble. __43__, the police arrived soon afterwards. They 

apologized to my friend for the __44__, but explained that a person who had used the same 

name as his was responsible for a number of recent robberies. Then the police asked my 

friend to copy out a note which had been used by the thief in a number of shops. The note 

__45__: ¡°I have a gun in my pocket. Ask no questions and give me all the money in the 

safe.¡± Fortunately, my friend¡¯s handwriting was quite unlike the thief¡¯s. He was not 

only allowed to go without further delay, but to take the string of pearls with him.

Have there always been cities? (71) Life without large urban areas may seem inconceivable 

to us, but actually cities are relatively recent development. Groups with primitive 

economics still manage without them. The trend, however, is for such groups to disappear, 

while cities are increasingly becoming the dominant mode of man¡¯s social existence. (72) 

Historically, city life has always been among the elements which form a civilization. Any 

high degree of human endeavor and achievement has been closely linked to life in an urban 

environment. (73) It is virtually impossible to imagine that universities, hospitals, 

large businesses or even science and technology could have come into being without cities 

to support them. To most people, cities have traditionally been the areas where there was 

a concentration of culture as well as of opportunity. (74) In recent years, however, 

people have begun to become aware that cities are also areas where there is a 

concentration of problems. What has happened to the modern American city? Actually, the 

problem is not such a new one. Long before this century started, there had begun a trend 

toward the concentration of the poor of the American society into the cities. Each great 

wave of immigration from abroad and from the rural areas made the problem worse. During 

this century, there has also been the development of large suburban areas surrounding the 

cities, for the rich prefer to live in these areas. Within the cities, sections may be 

sharply divided into high and low rent districts, the ¡°right side of town¡± and the 

slums.
Of course, everyone wants to do something about this unhappy situation. But there is no 

agreement as to goals. Neither is there any systematic approach or integrated program. 

Opinions are as diverse as the people who give them. (75) But one basic difference of 

opinion concerns the question of whether or not the city as such is to be preserved. 

Perhaps transportation and the means of communication have really made it possible for 

there to be an end to the big cities. Of course, there is the problem of persuading people 

to move out of them of their own free will. (76) And there is also the objection that the 

city has always been the core from which cultural advancement has radiated. Is this, 

however, still the case today in the presence of easy transportation and communication? 

Does culture arise as a result of people living together communally, or is it too the 

result of decisions made at the level of government and the communications industry?
It is probably true to say that most people prefer to preserve the cities. Some think that 

the cities could be cleaned up or totally rebuilt. This is easy to say; it would not be so 

easy to do. (77) To be sure, a great rebuilding project would give jobs to many of those 

people who need them. Living conditions could not help but improve, at least for a while. 

But would the problems return after the rebuilding was completed?
Nevertheless, with the majority of the people living in urban areas, the problem of the 

cities must be solved. (78) From agreement on this general goal, we have, unfortunately, 

in the past proceeded to disagreement on specific goals, and from there to total inaction. 

At the basis of much of this inaction is an old-fashioned concept -- the idea human 

conditions will naturally tend to regulate themselves for the general goal.

Section II: Reading Comprehension
Each of the three passages below is followed by some questions. For each question there 

are four answers. Read the passages carefully and chose the best answer to each of the 

questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (20 points)
Text 1
It doesn¡¯t come as a surprise to you to realize that it makes no difference what you read 

or study if you can¡¯t remember it. You just waste your valuable time. Maybe you have 

already discovered some clever ways to keep yourself from forgetting.
One dependable aid that does help you remember what you study is to have a specific 

purpose or reason for reading. You remember better what you read when you know why you¡¯re 

reading.
Why does a clerk in a store go away and leave you when your reply to her offer to help is, 

¡°No, thank you. I¡¯m just looking¡±? Both you and she know that if you aren¡¯t sure what 

you want, you are not likely to find it. But suppose you say instead, ¡°Yes, thank you. I 

want a pair of sun glasses.¡± She says, ¡°Right this way, please.¡± And you and she are 

off -- both eager to look for exactly what you want.
It¡¯s quite the same with your studying. If you chose a book at random, ¡°just looking¡± 

for nothing in particular, you are likely to get just that -- nothing. But if you do know 

what you want, and if you have the right book, you are almost sure to get it. Your reasons 

will vary; they will include reading or studying ¡°to find out more about¡±, ¡°to 

understand the reasons for¡±, ¡°to find out how¡±. A good student has a clear purpose or 

reason for what he is doing.
This is the way it works. Before you start to study, you say to yourself something like 

this, ¡°I want to know why Stephen Vincent Benet happened to write about America. I¡¯m 

reading this article to find out.¡± Or, ¡°I¡¯m going to skim this story to see what life 

was like in medieval England.¡± Because you know why you are reading or studying, you 

relate the information to your purpose and remember it better.
Reading is not one single activity. At least two important processes go on at the same 

time. As you read, you take in ideas rapidly and accurately. But at the same time you 

express your own ideas to yourself as you react to what you read. You have a kind of 

mental conversation with the author. If you expressed your ideas orally, they might sound 

like this: ¡°Yes, I agree. That¡¯s my opinion too.¡± or ¡°Ummmm, I thought that record was 

broken much earlier. I¡¯d better check those dates,¡± or ¡°But there are some other facts 

to be considered!¡± You don¡¯t just sit there taking in ideas -- you do something else, 

and that something else is very important.
This additional process of thinking about what you read includes evaluating it, relating 

it to what you already know, and using it for your own purposes. In other words, a good 

reader is a critical reader. One part of critical reading, as you have discovered, is 

distinguishing between facts and opinions. Facts can be checked by evidence. Opinions are 

one¡¯s own personal reactions.
Another part of critical reading is judging sources. Still another part is drawing 

accurate inferences.
16.	If you cannot remember what you read or study, ________.
[A] it is no surprise
[B] it means you have not really learned anything
[C] it means you have not chosen the right book
[D] you realize it is of no importance
17.	Before you start reading, it is important ________.
[A] to make sure why you are reading
[B] to relate the information to your purpose
[C] to remember what you read
[D] to choose an interesting book
18.	Reading activity involves ________.
[A] only two simultaneous processes
[B] primarily learning about ideas and evaluating them critically
[C] merely distinguishing between facts and opinions
[D] mainly drawing accurate inferences
19.	A good reader is one who ________.
[A] relates what he reads to his own knowledge about the subject matter
[B] does lots of thinking in his reading
[C] takes a critical attitude in his reading
[D] is able to check the facts presented against what he has already known
Text 2
If you live in a large city, you are quite familiar with some of the problems of noise, 

but because of some of its harmful effects, you may not be aware of the extent of its 

influence on human behavior. Although everyone more or less knows what noise is, i.e., it 

is sounds that one would rather not hear, it is perhaps best to define it more precisely 

for scientific purposes. One such definition is that noise is sounds that are unrelated to 

the task at hand. Thus stimuli that at one time might be considered relevant will at 

another time be considered noise, depending on what one is doing at the moment. In recent 

years there has been a great deal of interest in the effects of noise on human behavior, 

and concepts such as ¡°noise pollution¡± have arisen, together with movements to reduce 

noise.
Exposure to loud noises can definitely produce a partial or complete loss of hearing, 

depending on the intensity, duration, and frequency composition of the noise. Many jobs 

present noise hazards, such as working in factories and around jet aircraft, driving farm 

tractors, and working (or sitting) in music halls where rock bands are playing. In 

general, continuous exposure to sounds of over 80 decibels (a measure of the loudness of 

sound) can be considered dangerous. Decibel values correspond to various sounds. Sounds 

above about 85 decibels may, if exposure is for a sufficient period of time, produce 

significant hearing loss. Actual loss will depend upon the particular frequencies to which 

one is exposed, and whether the sound is continuous or intermittent.
Noise can have unexpected harmful effects on performance of certain kinds of tasks, for 

instance, if one is performing a watch keeping task that requires vigilance, in which he 

is responsible for detecting weak signals of some kind (e.g., watching a radar screen for 

the appearance of aircraft).
Communicating with other people is unfavorably affected by noise. If you have ridden in 

the rear of a jet transport, you may have noticed that it was difficult to carry on a 

conversation at first, and that, eventually, you adjusted the loudness of your speech to 

compensate for the effect. The problem is noise.
20.	Noise differs from sound in that ________.
[A] it is sounds that interfere with the task being done
[B] it is a special type of loud sound
[C] it is usually unavoidable in big cities
[D] it can be defined more precisely than the latter
21.	One of the harmful effects of noise on human performance is that ________.
[A] it reduces one¡¯s sensitivity
[B] it renders the victim helpless
[C] it deprives one of the enjoyment of music
[D] it drowns out conversations at worksites
22.	The purpose of this passage is ________.
[A] to define the effects of noise on human behavior
[B] to warn people of the danger of noise pollution
[C] to give advice as to how to prevent hearing loss
[D] to tell the difference between noise and sound

The traditional belief that a woman¡¯s place is in the home and that a woman ought not to 

go out to work can hardly be reasonably maintained in present conditions. It is said that 

it is a woman¡¯s task to care for the children, but families today tend to be small and 

with a year or two between children. Thus a woman¡¯s whole period of childbearing may 

occur within five years. Furthermore, with compulsory education from the age of five or 

six her role as chief educator of her children soon ceases. Thus, even if we agree that a 

woman should stay at home to look after her children before they are of school age, for 

many women, this period would extend only for about ten years.
It might be argued that the house-proud woman would still find plenty to do about the 

home. That may be so, but it is certainly no longer necessary for a woman to spend her 

whole life cooking, cleaning, mending and sewing. Washing machines take the drudgery out 

of laundry, the latest models being entirely automatic and able to wash and dry a large 

quantity of clothes in a few minutes. Refrigerators have made it possible to store food 

for long periods and many pre-cooked foods are obtainable in tins. Shopping, instead of 

being a daily task, can be completed in one day a week. The new man-made fibers are more 

hardwiring than natural fibers and greatly reduce mending, while good ready-made clothes 

are cheap and plentiful.
Apart from women¡¯s own happiness, the needs of the community must be considered. Modern 

society cannot do well without the contribution that women can make in professions and 

other kinds of work. There is a serious shortage of nurses and teachers, to mention only 

two of the occupations followed by women. It is extremely wasteful to give years of 

training at public expense only to have the qualified teacher or nurse marry after a year 

or two and be lost forever to her profession. The training, it is true, will help her in 

duties as a mother, but if she continued to work, her service would be more widely useful. 

Many factories and shops, too, are largely staffed by women, many of them married. While 

here the question of training is not so important, industry and trade would be seriously 

short of staff if married women did not work.
23.	The author holds that ________.
[A] the right place for all women, married or otherwise, is the home, not elsewhere
[B] all married women should have some occupation outside the home
[C] a married woman should give first priority to her duties as a mother
[D] it is desirable for uneducated married women to stay at home and take care of the 

family
24.	A house-proud woman ________.
[A] would devote her whole life to her family
[B] would take her own happiness and that of her family as her chief concern
[C] would still need some special training at public expense to help her in her duties as 

a housewife
[D] would take full advantage of modern household appliances
25.	According to the author, modern society ________.
[A] can operate just as well even without women participation
[B] has been greatly hampered in its development by the shortage of women nurses and women 

teachers
[C] cannot operate properly without the contribution of women
[D] will be seriously affected by the continuing shortage of working women in heavy 

industries and international trade

In 1620, a small sailboat named the Mayflower left England for the New World. The 

Mayflower headed for the Jamestown colony on the warm shore of Virginia. Its one hundred 

passengers were the Pilgrims. They were looking for a place where they could worship God 

__26__. Because of strong winds and severe storms, the Mayflower lost its __27__. The 

brave group of colonists finally had to land at Plymouth on the rocky coast of 

Massachusetts in December 1620. It was the middle of the stern northern winter. __28__ 

months of starvation, disease, and death were ahead of them. Only the strongest of the 

pilgrims __29__ that winter. Many women gave their own pitiful rations to their children 

and died for lack of food for themselves. Living __30__ began to improve in the spring of 

1621. There were wild vegetables. There were berries and fruit. Fish and game were 

plentiful. Therefore, they were able to get enough fresh meat despite their lack of skill 

or experience in hunting and fishing. The colonists¡¯ health __31__ with the warm weather 

and their better diet.
In the fall, they look back __32__ the past year. They were both regretful and thankful. 

Only fifty of the original one hundred passengers remained. The price in human life and 

tragedy had been great. On the other hand, they saw new hope for the future. A splendid 

harvest was __33__ them. They were ready for the second winter with confidence. They had 

eleven crude houses for protection against the severe winter. Seven were for families, and 

four were for communal use. __34__, they had established a treaty of friendship with their 

Indian neighbors under Chief Massasoit in the summer.
The woods and forests became safe. When the Mayflower returned to England that summer, 

there were no colonists __35__. At the end of their first year in their new home, the 

Pilgrims wanted to celebrate with a real holiday. It was their first Thanks giving Day.

Seated behind the front desk at a New York firm, the receptionist was efficient.
Stylishly dressed, the firm¡¯s newest employee had a pleasant telephone voice and a 

natural charm that put clients at ease. The company was pleased: (61) Clearly, this was a 

person who took considerable pride in personal appearance. David King, the receptionist, 

is unusual, but by no means unique. (62) Just as all truck drivers and construction 

workers are no longer necessarily men, all secretaries and receptionists are no longer 

automatically women. The number of men in women-dominated fields is still small and they 

haven¡¯t attracted the attention that has often followed women advancing into male-

dominated fields, but men are moving into more and more jobs that have traditionally been 

held by women.
Strictly speaking, the phenomenon is not new. For the past several decades, men have been 

quietly entering fields such as nursing, social work and elementary education. But today 

no job seems off-limits. Men serve coffee in offices and meals on airplanes. (63) These 

changes are helping to influence some of the long-standing traditions about the types of 

work men and women can do -- but they also produce some undeniable problems for the men 

who are entering those fields formerly dominated by women.
What kinds of men venture into these so-called ¡°women¡¯s fields¡±? All kinds. (64) ¡°I don

¡¯t know of any definite answers I¡¯d be comfortable with,¡± explains Joseph Pleck, Ph.D., 

of the Wellesley College Centre for Research on Women.
Sam Ormont, for example, a thirty-year-old nurse at a Boston hospital, went into nursing 

because the army had trained him as a medical worker. (65) ¡°I found that work very 

interesting.¡± he recalled, ¡°and when I got out of the service it just seemed natural for 

me to go into something medical. I wasn¡¯t really interested in becoming a doctor.¡± 

Thirty-five-year-old David King, an out-of-work actor, found a job as a receptionist 

because he was having trouble landing roles in Broadway plays and he needed to pay the 

rent.
(66) In other words, men enter ¡°female¡± jobs out of the same consideration for personal 

interest and economic necessity that motivates anyone looking for work. But similarities 

often end there. Men in female-dominated jobs are conspicuous. As a group, their work 

histories differ in most respects from those of their female colleagues, and they are 

frequently treated differently by the people with whom they are in professional contact.
The question naturally arises: Why are there still approximately ninety-nine female 

secretaries for every one male? There is also a more serious issue. Most men don¡¯t want 

to be receptionists, nurses, secretaries or sewing workers. Put simply, these are not 

generally considered very masculine jobs. (67) To choose such a line of work is to invite 

ridicule.
¡°There was kidding in the beginning,¡± recalls Ormont. ¡°Kids coming from school ask what 

I am, and when I say ¡®A nurse,¡¯ they laugh at me. I just smile and say, ¡®You know, 

there are female doctors, too.¡¯¡±
Still, there are encouraging signs. Years ago, male grade school teachers were as rare as 

male nurses. Today more than one elementary school teacher in six is male.
(68) Can we anticipate a day when secretaries will be an even mix of men and women -- or 

when the mention of a male nurse will no longer raise eyebrows? It¡¯s probably coming -- 

but not very soon.

Section II: Reading Comprehension
Each of the three passages below is followed by some questions. For each question there 

are four answers. Read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the 

questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (20 points)
Test 1
A scientist once said: ¡°I have concluded that the earth is being visited by intelligently 

controlled vehicles from outer space.¡±
If we take this as a reasonable explanation for UFOs (unidentified flying objects), 

questions immediately come up.
¡°Why don¡¯t they get in touch with us, then? Why don¡¯t they land right on the White 

House lawn and declare themselves?¡± people asked.
In reply, scientists say that, while this may be what we want, it may not necessarily be 

what they want.
¡°The most likely explanation, it seems to me,¡± said Dr. Mead, ¡°is that they are simply 

watching what we are up to -- that responsible society outside our solar system is keeping 

an eye on us to see that we don¡¯t set in motion a chain reaction that might have 

unexpected effects for outside our solar system.¡±
Opinions from other scientists might go like this: ¡°Why should they want to get in touch 

with us? We may feel we¡¯re more important than we really are! They may want to observe us 

only and not interfere with the development of our civilization. They may not care if we 

see them but they also may not care to say ¡®hello¡¯.¡±
Some scientists have also suggested that Earth is a kind of zoo or wildlife reserve. Just 

as we set aside wilderness areas and wildlife reserves to allow animals and growing things 

to develop naturally while we observe them, so perhaps Earth was set aside ages ago for 

the same purpose.
Are we being observed by intelligent beings from other civilizations in the universe? Are 

they watching our progress in space travel? Do we live in a gigantic ¡°zoo¡± observed by 

our ¡°keepers,¡± but having no communication with them?
Never before in our history have we had to confront ideas like these. The simple fact is 

that we, who have always regarded ourselves as supreme in the universe, may not be so. Now 

we have to recognize that, among the stars in the heavens, there may very well be worlds 

inhabited by beings who are to us as we are to ants.
16.	People who ask the question ¡°Why don¡¯t they get in touch with us... and declare 

themselves?¡± think that ________.
[A] there are no such things as UFOs
[B] UFOs are visitors from solar system
[C] there¡¯s no reason for UFOs sooner or later
[D] we are bound to see UFOs sooner or later
17.	According to Dr. Mead, the attitude of beings from outer space toward us is one of 

________.
[A] unfriendliness
[B] suspicion
[C] superiority
[D] hostility
18.	The tone of the writer is that of ________.
[A] doubt
[B] warning
[C] indifference
[D] criticism
Test 2
The use of the motor is becoming more and more widespread in the twentieth century; as an 

increasing number of countries develop both technically and economically, so a larger 

proportion of the world¡¯s population is able to buy and use a car. Possessing a car gives 

a much greater degree of mobility, enabling the driver to move around freely. The owner of 

a car is no longer forced to rely on public transport and is, therefore, not compelled to 

work locally. He can choose from different jobs and probably changes his work more 

frequently as he is not restricted to a choice within a small radius. Travelling to work 

by car is also more comfortable than having to use public transport; the driver can adjust 

the heating in winter and the air conditioning in the summer to suit his own needs and 

preference. There is no irritation caused by waiting for trains, buses or underground 

trains, standing in long patient queues, or sitting on windy platforms, for as long as 

half an hour sometimes. With the building of good, fast motorways long distances can be 

covered rapidly and pleasantly. For the first time in this century also, many people are 

now able to enjoy their leisure time to the full by making trips to the country or seaside 

at the weekends, instead of being confined to their immediate neighbourhood. This feeling 

of independence, and the freedom to go where you please, is perhaps the greatest advantage 

of the car.
When considering the drawbacks, perhaps pollution is of prime importance. As more and more 

cars are produced and used, so the emission from their exhaust-pipes contains an ever 

larger volume of poisonous gas. Some of the contents of this gas, such as lead, not only 

pollute the atmosphere but cause actual harm to the health of people. Many of the minor 

illnesses of modern industrial society, headaches, tiredness, and stomach upsets are 

thought to arise from breathing polluted air; doctors¡¯ surgeries are full of people 

suffering from illnesses caused by pollution. It is also becoming increasingly difficult 

to deal with the problem of traffic in towns; most of the important cities of the world 

suffer from traffic congestion. In fact any advantage gained in comfort is often cancelled 

out in city driving by the frustration caused by traffic jams: endless queues of cars 

crawling one after another through all the main streets. As an increasing number of 

traffic regulation schemes are devised, the poor bewildered driver finds himself diverted 

and forced into one-way systems which cause even greater delays than the traffic jams they 

are supposed to prevent. The mounting cost of petrol and the increased license fees and 

road tax all add to the driver¡¯s worries. In fact, he must sometimes wonder if the motor 

car is such a blessing and not just a menace.
19.	More and more people can afford to buy and use cars because ________.
[A] an increasing number of cars are being produced
[B] the cost of cars is getting cheaper with the development of technology
[C] lots of countries have become more developed
[D] the use of cars has proved to be more economical
20.	The advantages of having a car are best experienced in the driver¡¯s ________.
[A] freedom in choosing his job
[B] comfort during the travels
[C] enjoyment of his leisure time
[D] feeling of self-reliance
21.	What is considered by the writer as the greatest menace to the people caused by 

the widespread use of motor cars?
[A] air pollution
[B] traffic jams
[C] fatal diseases
[D] high cost
Test 3
Manners nowadays in metropolitan cities like London are practically non-existent. It is 

nothing for a big, strong schoolboy to elbow an elderly woman aside in the dash for the 

last remaining seat on the tube or bus, much less stand up and offer his seat to her, as 

he ought. In fact, it is saddening to note that if a man does offer his seat to an older 

woman, it is nearly always a Continental man or one from the older generation.
This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued about by young men, 

who say that, since women have claimed equality, they no longer deserve to be treated with 

courtesy and that those who go out to work should take their turn in the rat race like 

anyone else. Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. Even if it is not 

agreed, however, that young men should stand up for younger women, the fact remains that 

courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and the burdened. Are we really so lost to 

all ideals of unselfishness that we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a 

book, saying to ourselves ¡°First come, first served,¡± while a grey-haired woman, a 

mother with a young child or a cripple stands? Yet this is all too often seen.
Conditions in travel are really very hard on everyone, we know, but hardship is surely no 

excuse. Sometimes one wonders what would have been the behaviour of these stout young men 

in a packed refugee train or a train on its way to a prison-camp during the War. Would 

they have considered it only right and their proper due to keep the best places for 

themselves then?
Older people, tired and irritable from a day¡¯s work, are not angels, either -- far from 

it. Many a brisk argument or an insulting quarrel breaks out as the weary queues push and 

shove each other to get on buses and tubes. One cannot commend this, of course, but one 

does feel there is just a little more excuse.
If cities are to remain pleasant places to live in at all, however, it seems imperative, 

not only that communications in transport should be improved, but also that communication 

between human beings should be kept smooth and polite. All over cities, it seems that 

people are too tired and too rushed to be polite. Shop assistants won¡¯t bother to assist, 

taxi drivers growl at each other as they dash dangerously round corners, bus conductor 

pull the bell before their desperate passengers have had time to get on or off the bus, 

and so on and so on. It seems to us that it is up to the young and strong to do their 

small part to stop such deterioration.
22.	From what you have read, would you expect manners to improve among people 

________?
[A] who are physically weak or crippled
[B] who once lived in a prison-camp during the War
[C] who live in big modern cities
[D] who live only in metropolitan cities
23.	What is the writer¡¯s opinion concerning courteous manners towards women?
[A] Now that women have claimed equality, they no longer need to be treated differently 

from men.
[B] It is generally considered old-fashioned for young men to give up their seats to young 

women.
[C] ¡°Lady First¡± should be universally practiced.
[D] Special consideration ought to be shown them.
24.	According to the author communication between human beings would be smoother if 

________.
[A] people were more considerate towards each other
[B] people were not so tired and irritable
[C] women were treated with more courtesy
[D] public transport could be improved
25.	What is the possible meaning of the word ¡°deterioration¡± in the last paragraph?
[A] worsening of general situation
[B] lowering of moral standards
[C] declining of physical constitution

One day drought may be a thing of the past at least in coastal cities. Vast areas of 

desert throughout the world may for the first time __26__ and provide millions of hectares 

of land where now nothing grows.
By the end of this century this may not be mere __27__. Scientists are already looking 

into the possibility of using some of the available ice in the Arctic and Antarctic. In 

these regions there are vast ice-caps formed by snow that has fallen over the past 50,000 

years. Layer __28__ layer of deep snow means that, when melted, the snow water would be 

pure, not salty as sea-ice would be. There is so much __29__ pure water here that it would 

need only a fraction of it to turn much of the desert or poorly irrigated parts of the 

world into rich farmland. And what useful packages it would come in! It should be possible 

to cut off a bit of ice and transport it! Alternatively perhaps a passing iceberg could be 

__30__. They are always breaking away from the main caps and floating around, pushed by 

currents, until they eventually melt and are wasted.
Many icebergs are, of course, far too small to be towed __31__ distance, and would melt 

before they reached a country that needed them anywhere. It would be necessary to locate 

one that was __32__ and that was big enough to provide a good supply of ice when it 

reached us. Engineers think that an iceberg up to seven miles long and one and a half 

miles wide could be transported if the tug pulling it was as big as a supertanker! Even 

then they would cover only twenty miles every day. However, __33__ the iceberg was at its 

destination, more that 7,000 million cubic metres of water could be taken from it! That 

would probably be more than enough for any medium-sized city even in the hottest summer! 

But no doubt a use could be found for it. __34__, scientist say, there would not be too 

much wastage in such a journey. The larger the iceberg, the slower it melts, even if it is 

towed through the tropics. This is because when the sun has a bigger area to warm __35__, 

less heat actually gets into the iceberg. The vast frozen centre would be unaffected.

When Jane Matheson started work at Advanced Electronics Inc. 12 years ago, (61) she 

laboured over a microscope, hand-welding tiny electronic computers and turned out 18 per 

hour. Now she tends the computerized machinery that turns out high capacity memory chips 

at the rate of 2,600 per hour. Production is up, profits are up, her income is up and Mrs. 

Matheson says the work is far less strain on her eyes.
But the most significant effect of the changes at AEI was felt by the workers who are no 

longer there. Before the new computerized equipment was introduced, there were 940 workers 

at the plant. Now there are 121. (62) A plant follow-up survey showed that one year after 

the layoffs only 38% of the released workers found new employment at the same or better 

wages. Nearly half finally settled for lower pay and more than 13% are still out of work. 

The AEI example is only one of hundreds around the country which forge intelligently ahead 

into the latest technology, but leave the majority of their workers behind.
(63) Its beginnings obscured by unemployment caused by the world economic slow-down, the 

new technological unemployment may emerge as the great socio-economic challenge of the end 

of the 20th century. One corporation economist says the growth of ¡°machine job 

replacement¡± has been with us since the beginning of the industrial revolution, but never 

at the pace it is now. The human costs will be astonishing. (64) ¡°It¡¯s humiliating to be 

done out of your job by a machine and there is no way to fight back, but it is the effort 

to find a new job that really hurts.¡± Some workers, like Jane Matheson, are retrained to 

handle the new equipment, but often a whole new set of skills is required and that means a 

new, and invariably smaller set of workers. (65) The old workers, trapped by their limited 

skills, often never regain their old status and employment. Many drift into marginal 

areas. They feel no pride in their new work. They get badly paid for it and they feel 

miserable, but still they are luckier than those who never find it.
(66) The social costs go far beyond the welfare and unemployment payments made by the 

government. Unemployment increases the chances of divorce, child abuse, and alcoholism, a 

new federal survey shows. Some experts say the problem is only temporary... that new 

technology will eventually create as many jobs as it destroys. (67) But futurologist Hymen 

Seymour says the astonishing efficiency of the new technology means there will be a simple 

and direct net reduction in the amount of human labor that needs to be done. ¡°We should 

treat this as an opportunity to give people more leisure. It may not be easy, but society 

will have to reach a new unanimity on the division and distribution of labor,¡± Seymour 

says. He predicts most people will work only six-hour days and four-day weeks by the end 

of the century. But the concern of the unemployed is for now. (68) Federally funded 

training and free back-to-school programs for laid-off workers are under way, but few 

experts believe they will be able to keep up with the pace of the new technology. For the 

next few years, for a substantial portion of the workforce, times are going to be very 

tough indeed.

In May l989, space shuttle ¡°Atlantis¡± released in outer space the space probe 

¡°Megallan,¡± which is now on her 15-month and one-billion-kilometer flight to Venus. A 

new phase in space exploration has begun.
The planet Venus is only slightly smaller than Earth; it is the only other object in the 

solar system, in fact, that even comes close to earth¡¯s size. Venus has a similar 

density, so it is probably made of approximately the same stuff, and it has an atmosphere, 

complete with clouds. It is also the closest planet to earth, and thus the most similar in 

distance from the sun. In short, Venus seems to justify its long-held nickname of ¡°earth

¡¯s twin.¡±
The surface temperature of Venus reaches some 900F. Added to that is an atmospheric 

pressure about 90 times Earth¡¯s: High overhead in the carbon dioxide (CO2) that passes 

for air is a layer of clouds, perhaps 10 to 20 miles thick, whose little drops consist 

mostly of sulfuric acid (H2SO4). Water is all but nonexistent.
Born with so many fundamental similarities to earth, how did Venus get to be so radically 

different: It is not just an academic matter. For all its extremes, Venus is a valuable 

laboratory for researchers studying the weather and climate of earth. It has no earth¡¯s 

oceans, so the heat transport and other mechanisms are greatly simplified. In addition, 

the planet Venus takes 243 earth-days to turn once on its axis, so incoming heat from the 

sun is added and distributed at a more leisurely, observable pace.
16.	Venus is similar to Earth in ________.
[A] size and density
[B] distance from the sun
[C] having atmosphere
[D] all of the above
17.	The greatest value in studying Venus should be to ________.
[A] allow us to visit there
[B] understand Earth better
[C] find a new source of energy
[D] promote a new space program
18.	The main idea of this passage is about ________.
[A] problems of space travel
[B] scientific methods in space exploration
[C] the importance of Venus to Earth
[D] conditions on Venus

Tourists were surprised to see a woman driving a huge orange tractor down one of Rome¡¯s 

main avenues. Italy¡¯s political leaders and some of its male union chiefs are said to 

have been even more puzzled to see that the tractor was followed by about 200,000 women in 

a parading procession that took more than three hours to snake through central Rome.
Shouting slogans, waving flags and dancing to drumbeats, the women had come to the capital 

from all over Italy to demonstrate for ¡°a job for each of us, a different type of job, 

and a society without violence.¡± So far, action to improve women¡¯s opportunities in 

employment has been the province of collective industrial bargaining. ¡°But there is a 

growing awareness that this is not enough,¡± says a researcher on female labor at the 

government-funded Institute for the Development of Professional Training for Workers.
Women, who constitute 52 per cent of Italy¡¯s population, today represent only 35 per cent 

of Italy¡¯s total workforce and 33 per cent of the total number of Italians with jobs. 

However, their presence in the workplace is growing. The employment of women is expanding 

considerably in services, next to the public administration and commerce as their 

principal workplace. Official statistics also show that women have also made significant 

strides in self-employment. More and more women are going into business for themselves. 

Many young women are turning to business because of the growing overall in employment. It 

is also a fact that today many prejudices have disappeared, so that banks and other 

financial institutes make judgments on purely business considerations without caring if it 

is a man or a woman.
Such changes are occurring in the professions too. The number of women doctors, dentists, 

lawyers, engineers and university professors increased two to three fold. Some of the 

changes are immediately visible. For example, women have appeared on the scene for the 

first time as state police, railway workers and street cleaner.
However, the present situation is far from satisfactory though some progress has been 

made. A breakthrough in equal opportunities for women is now demanded.
19.	The expression ¡°snake through central Rome¡± probably means ¡°to move ________
[A] quietly through central Rome.¡±
[B] violently through central Rome.¡±
[C] in a long winding line through central Rome.¡±
[D] at a leisurely pace through central Rome.¡±
20.	Which of the following statements is NOT true?
[A] There are more women than men in Italy.
[B] In Italy, women are chiefly employed in services.
[C] In Italy, women are still at a disadvantage in employment.
[D] In Italy, about two-thirds of the jobs are held by men.
21.	About 200,000 women in Rome demonstrated for ________.
[A] more job opportunities
[B] a greater variety of jobs
[C] ¡°equal job, equal pay¡±
[D] both A and B
22.	The best title for this passage would be ________.
[A] The Role of Women is Society
[B] Women Demonstrate for Equality in Employment
[C] Women as Self-employed Professionals
[D] Women and the Jobs Market
Text 3
The old idea that talented children ¡°burn themselves out¡± in the early years, and, 

therefore, are subjected to failure and at worst, mental illness is unfounded. As a matter 

of fact, the outstanding thing that happens to bright kids is that they are very likely to 

grow into bright adults.
To find this out, l, 500 gifted persons were followed up to their thirty-fifth year with 

these results:
On adult intelligence tests, they scored as high as they had as children. They were, as a 

group, in good health, physically and mentally. 84 per cent of their group were married 

and seemed content with their lives.
About 70 per cent had graduated from college, though only 30 per cent had graduated with 

honors. A few had even dropped out, but nearly half of these had returned to graduate. Of 

the men, 80 per cent were in one of the professions or in business management or 

semiprofessional jobs. The women who had remained single had office, business, or 

professional occupations.
The group had published 90 books and 1,500 articles in scientific, scholarly, and literary 

magazines and had collected more than 100 patents.
In a material way they did not do badly either. Average income was considerably higher 

among the gifted people, especially the men, than for the country as a whole, despite 

their comparative youth.
In fact, far from being strange, most of the gifted were turning their early promise into 

practical reality.
23.	The old idea that talented children ¡°burn themselves out¡± in the early years is 

________.
[A] true in all senses
[B] refuted by the author
[C] medically proven
[D] a belief of the author
24.	The survey of bright children was made to ________.
[A] find out what had happened to talented children when they became adults
[B] prove that talented children ¡°burn themselves out¡± in the early years
[C] discover the percentage of those mentally ill among the gifted
[D] prove that talented children never burn themselves out
25.	Intelligence tests showed that ________.
[A] bright children were unlikely to be mentally healthy
[B] between childhood and adulthood there was a considerable loss of intelligence
[C] talented children were most likely to become gifted adults
[D] when talented children grew into adults, they made low scores

No one knows for sure what the world would be like in the year 2001. Many books have been 

written __26__ the future. But the 19th-century French novelist Jules Verne may be called 

a futurologist in the fullest __27__ of the word. In his fantastic novels ¡°A Trip to the 

Moon¡± and ¡°80 Days Around the World,¡± he described with detail the aeroplane and even 

the helicopter. These novels still have a great attraction __28__ young readers of today 

because of their bold imagination and scientific accuracy.
Below is a description of what our life will be in the year 2001 as predicted by a __29__ 

writer.
In 2001, in the home, cookers will be set so that you can cook a complete meal at the 

touch of a switch.
Television will provide information on prices at the __30__ shops as well as news and 

entertainment. Videophones will bring pictures as well as __31__ to telephone 

conversations.
Machines will control temperature, lighting, entertainment, security alarms, laundry and 

gardening.
Lighting will provide decoration as well as wallpaper.
At work, robots will take __32__ most jobs in the manufacturing industries. Working hours 

will fall to under 30 hours a week. Holidays will get longer; six weeks will be the normal 

annual holiday. Men and women will retire at the same age.
Our leisure will be different too. The home will become the center of entertainment 

through television and electronic games. More people will eat out in restaurants __33__ 

they do today; also they will have a much wider variety of food available. There will be a 

change of taste towards a more savoury-flavored menu. New synthetic foods will form a 

__34__ part of people¡¯s diets.
Foreign travel will __35__; winter holidays will become more popular than summer ones.
Also non-stop flights from Britain to Australia and New Zealand will be easily available 

and much cheaper. Education will become increasingly more important than ever before.

Translate the following passage carefully and then translate the sentences underlined into 

Chinese. (20 points)
People have wondered for a long time how their personalities and behaviors are formed. It 

is not easy to explain why one person is intelligent and another is not, or why one is 

cooperative and another is competitive.
Social scientists are, of course, extremely interested in these types of questions. (61) 

They want to explain why we possess certain characteristics and exhibit certain behaviors. 

There are no clear answers yet, but two distinct schools of thought on the matter have 

developed. As one might expect, the two approaches are very different from each other. The 

controversy is often conveniently referred to as ¡°nature vs. nurture.¡±
(62) Those who support the ¡°nature¡± side of the conflict believe that our personalities 

and behavior patterns are largely determined by biological factors. (63) That our 

environment has little, if anything, to do with our abilities, characteristics and 

behavior is central to this theory.
Taken to an extreme, this theory maintains that our behavior is pre-determined to such a 

great degree that we are almost completely governed by our instincts.
Those who support the ¡°nurture¡± theory, that is, they advocate education, are often 

called behaviorists. They claim that our environment is more important than our 

biologically based instincts in determining how we will act. A behaviorist, B. F. Skinner, 

sees humans as beings whose behavior is almost completely shaped by their surroundings. 

(64) The behaviorists maintain that, like machines, humans respond to environmental 

stimuli as the basis of their behavior.
Let us examine the different explanations about one human characteristic, intelligence, 

offered by the two theories. (65) Supporters of the ¡°nature¡± theory insist that we are 

born with a certain capacity for learning that is biologically determined. Needless to 

say: They don¡¯t believe that factors in the environment have much influence on what is 

basically a predetermined characteristic. On the other hand, behaviorists argue that our 

intelligence levels are the product of our experiences. (66) Behaviorists suggest that the 

child who is raised in an environment where there are many stimuli which develop his or 

her capacity for appropriate responses will experience greater intellectual development.
The social and political implications of these two theories are profound. (67) In the 

United States, blacks often score below whites on standardized intelligence tests. This 

leads some ¡°nature¡± proponents to conclude that blacks are biologically inferior to 

whites. (68) Behaviorists, in contrast, say that differences in scores are due to the fact 

that blacks are often deprived of many of the educational and other environmental 

advantages that whites enjoy.
Most people think neither of these theories can yet fully explain human behavior.

Section II: Reading Comprehension
Each of the passages below is followed by some questions. For ach question four answers 

are given. Read the passages carefully and choose the best answer to each of the 

questions. Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (30 points)
Text l
A wise man once said that the only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men 

to do nothing. So, as a police officer, I have some urgent things to say to good people.
Day after day my men and I struggle to hold back a tidal wave of crime. Something has gone 

terribly wrong with our once-proud American way of life. It has happened in the area of 

values. A key ingredient is disappearing, and I think I know what it is: accountability.
Accountability isn¡¯t hard to define. It means that every person is responsible for his or 

her actions and liable for their consequences.
Of the many values that hold civilization together -- honesty, kindness, and so on -- 

accountability may be the most important of all. Without it, there can be no respect, no 

trust, no law -- and, ultimately, no society.
My job as a police officer is to impose accountability on people who refuse, or have never 

learned, to impose it on themselves. But as every policeman knows, external controls on 

people¡¯s behavior are far less effective than internal restraints such as guilt, shame 

and embarrassment.
Fortunately there are still communities -- smaller towns, usually -- where schools 

maintain discipline and where parents hold up standards that proclaim: ¡°In this family 

certain things are not tolerated -- they simply are not done!¡±
Yet more and more, especially in our larger cities and suburbs, these inner restraints are 

loosening. Your typical robber has none. He considers your property his property; he takes 

what he wants, including your life if you enrage him.
The main cause of this break-down is a radical shift in attitudes. Thirty years ago, if a 

crime was committed, society was considered the victim. Now, in a shocking reversal, it¡¯s 

the criminal who is considered victimized: by his underprivileged upbringing, by the 

school that didn¡¯t teach him to read, by the church that failed to reach him with moral 

guidance, by the parents who didn¡¯t provide a stable home.
I don¡¯t believe it. Many others in equally disadvantaged circumstances choose not to 

engage in criminal activities. If we free the criminal, even partly, from accountability, 

we become a society of endless excuses where no one accepts responsibility for anything.
We in America desperately need more people who believe that the person who commits a crime 

is the one responsible for it.
31.	What the wise man said suggests that ________.
[A] it¡¯s unnecessary for good people to do anything in face of evil
[B] it¡¯s certain that evil will prevail if good men do nothing about it
[C] it¡¯s only natural for virtue to defeat evil
[D] it¡¯s desirable for good men to keep away from evil
32.	According to the author, if a person is found guilty of a crime, ________.
[A] society is to be held responsible
[B] modern civilization is responsible for it
[C] the criminal himself should bear the blame
[D] the standards of living should be improved
33.	Compared with those in small towns, people in large cities have ________.
[A] less self-discipline
[B] better sense of discipline
[C] more mutual respect
[D] less effective government
34.	The writer is sorry to have noticed that ________.
[A] people in large cities tend to excuse criminals
[B] people in small towns still stick to old discipline and standards
[C] today¡¯s society lacks sympathy for people in difficulty
[D] people in disadvantaged circumstances are engaged in criminal activities
35.	The key point of the passage is that ________.
[A] stricter discipline should be maintained in schools and families
[B] more good examples should be set for people to follow
[C] more restrictions should be imposed on people¡¯s behavior
[D] more people should accept the value of accountability
Text 2
The period of adolescence, i.e., the period between childhood and adulthood, may be long 

or short, depending on social expectations and on society¡¯s definition as to what 

constitutes maturity and adulthood. In primitive societies adolescence is frequently a 

relatively short period of time, while in industrial societies with patterns of prolonged 

education coupled with laws against child labor, the period of adolescence is much longer 

and may include most of the second decade of one¡¯s life. Furthermore, the length of the 

adolescent period and the definition of adulthood status may change in a given society as 

social and economic conditions change. Examples of this type of change are the 

disappearance of the frontier in the latter part of the nineteenth century in the United 

States, and more universally, the industrialization of an agricultural society.
In modern society, ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal recognition and 

symbolic significance and there no longer is agreement as to what constitutes initiation 

ceremonies. Social ones have been replaced by a sequence of steps that lead to increased 

recognition and social status. For example, grade school graduation, high school 

graduation and college graduation constitute such a sequence, and while each step implies 

certain behavioral changes and social recognition, the significance of each depends on the 

socio-economic status and the educational ambition of the individual. Ceremonies for 

adolescence have also been replaced by legal definitions of status roles, right, 

privileges and responsibilities. It is during the nine years from the twelfth birthday to 

the twenty-first that the protective and restrictive aspects of childhood and minor status 

are removed and adult privileges and responsibilities are granted. The twelve-year-old is 

no longer considered a child and has to pay full fare for train, airplane, theater and 

movie tickets. Basically, the individual at this age loses childhood privileges without 

gaining significant adult rights. At the age of sixteen the adolescent is granted certain 

adult rights which increases his social status by providing him with more freedom and 

choices. He now can obtain a driver¡¯s license; he can leave public schools; and he can 

work without the restrictions of child labor laws. At the age of eighteen the law provides 

adult responsibilities as well as rights; the young man can now be a soldier, but he also 

can marry without parental permission. At the age of twenty-one the individual obtains his 

full legal rights as an adult. He now can vote, he can buy liquor, he can enter into 

financial contracts, and he is entitled to run for public office. No additional basic 

rights are acquired as a function of age after majority status has been attained. None of 

these legal provisions determine at what point adulthood has been reached but they do 

point to the prolonged period of adolescence.
36.	The period of adolescence is much longer in industrial societies because ________.
[A] the definition of maturity has changed
[B] the industrialized society is more developed
[C] more education is provided and laws against child labor are made
[D] ceremonies for adolescence have lost their formal recognition and symbolic 

significance
37.	Former social ceremonies that used to mark adolescence have given place to 

________.
[A] graduations from schools and colleges
[B] social recognition
[C] socio-economic status
[D] certain behavioral changes
38.	No one can expect to fully enjoy the adulthood privileges until he is ________.
[A] eleven years old
[B] sixteen years old
[C] twenty-one years old
[D] between twelve and twenty-one years old
39.	Starting from 22, ________.
[A] one will obtain more basic rights
[B] the older one becomes, the more basic rights he will have
[C] one won¡¯t get more basic rights than when he is 21
[D] one will enjoy more rights granted by society
40.	According to the passage, it is true that ________.
[A] in the late 19th century in the United States the dividing line between adolescence 

and adulthood no longer existed
[B] no one can marry without the permission of his parents until the age of twenty-one
[C] one is considered to have reached adulthood when he has a driver¡¯s license
[D] one is not free from the restrictions of child labor laws until he can join the army
Text 3
Most growing plants contain much more water than all other materials combined. C. R. 

Darnes has suggested that it is as proper to term the plant a water structure as to call a 

house composed mainly of brick -- a brick building. Certain it is that all essential 

processes of plant growth and development occur in water. The mineral elements from the 

soil that are usable by the plant must be dissolved in the soil solution before they can 

be taken into the root. They are carried to all parts of the growing plant and are built 

into essential plant materials while in a dissolved state. The carbon dioxide from the air 

may enter the leaf as a gas but is dissolved in water in the leaf before it is combined 

with a part of the water to form simple sugars -- the base material from which the plant 

body is mainly built. Actively growing plant parts are generally 75 to 90 percent water. 

Structural parts of plants, such as woody stems no longer actively growing, may have much 

less water than growing tissues.
The actual amount of water in the plant at any one time, however, is only a very small 

part of what passes through it during its development. The processes of photosynthesis, by 

which carbon dioxide and water are combined -- in the presence of chlorophyll and 

with energy derived from light -- to form sugars, require that carbon dioxide from the air 

enter the plant. This occurs mainly in the leaves. The leaf surface is not solid but 

contains great numbers of minute openings, through which the carbon dioxide enters. The 

same structure that permits the one gas to enter the leaf, however, permits another gas -- 

water vapor -- to be lost from it. Since carbon dioxide is present in the air only in 

trace quantities (3 to 4 parts in 10,000 parts of air) and water vapor is near saturation 

in the air spaces within the leaf (at 80F, saturated air would contain about 186 parts of 

water vapor in 10,000 parts of air), the total amount of water vapor lost is many times 

the carbon dioxide intake. Actually, because of wind and other factors, the loss of water 

in proportion to carbon dioxide intake may be even greater than the relative 

concentrations of the two gases. Also, not all of the carbon dioxide that enters the leaf 

is synthesized into carbohydrates.
41.	A growing plant needs water for all of the following except ________.
[A] forming sugars
[B] sustaining woody stems
[C] keeping green
[D] producing carbon dioxide
42.	The essential function of photosynthesis in terms of plant needs is ________.
[A] to form sugars
[B] to derive energy from light
[C] to preserve water
[D] to combine carbon dioxide with water
43.	The second paragraph uses facts to develop the essential idea that ________.
[A] a plant efficiently utilizes most of the water it absorbs
[B] carbon dioxide is the essential substance needed for plant development
[C] a plant needs more water than is found in its composition
[D] the stronger the wind, the more the water vapor loss
44.	According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE?
[A] The mineral elements will not be absorbed by the plant unless they are dissolved in 

its root.
[B] The woody stems contain more water than the leaves.
[C] Air existing around the leaf is found to be saturated.
[D] Only part of the carbon dioxide in the plants is synthesized.
45.	This passage is mainly about ________.
[A] the functions of carbon dioxide and water
[B] the role of water in a growing plant
[C] the process of simple sugar formation
[D] the synthesis of water with carbon dioxide

Chinese. (15 points)
The fact is that the energy crisis, which has suddenly been officially announced, has been 

with us for a long time now, and will be with us for an even longer time. Whether Arab oil 

flows freely or not, it is clear to everyone that world industry cannot be allowed to 

depend on so fragile a base. (71) The supply of oil can be shut off unexpectedly at any 

time, and in any case, the oil wells will all run dry in thirty years or so at the present 

rate of use. (72) New sources of energy must be found, and this will take time, but it is 

not likely to result in any situation that will ever restore that sense of cheap and 

plentiful energy we have had in the times past. For an indefinite period from here on, 

mankind is going to advance cautiously, and consider itself lucky that it can advance at 

all.
To make the situation worse, there is as yet no sign that any slowing of the world¡¯s 

population is in sight. Although the birth-rate has dropped in some nations, including the 

United States, the population of the world seems sure to pass six billion and perhaps even 

seven billion as the twenty-first century opens.
(73) The food supply will not increase nearly enough to match this, which means that we 

are heading into a crisis in the matter of producing and marketing food.
Taking all this into account, what might we reasonably estimate supermarkets to be like in 

the year 2001?
To begin with, the world food supply is going to become steadily tighter over the next 

thirty years -- even here in the United States. By 2001, the population of the United 

States will be at least two hundred fifty million and possibly two hundred seventy 

million, and the nation will find it difficult to expand food production to fill the 

additional mouths. (74) This will be particularly true since energy pinch will make it 

difficult to continue agriculture in the high-energy American fashion that makes it 

possible to combine few farmers with high yields.
It seems almost certain that by 200l the United States will no longer be a great food-

exporting nation and that, if necessity forces exports, it will be at the price of belt-

tightening at home.
In fact, as food items will tend to decline in quality and decrease in variety, there is 

very likely to be increasing use of flavouring additives. (75) Until such time as mankind 

has the sense to lower its population to the point where the planet can provide a 

comfortable support for all, people will have to accept more ¡°unnatural food¡±.

Each of the passages below is followed by some questions. For each question four answers 

are given. Read the passage carefully and choose the best answer to each of the questions. 

Put your choice in the ANSWER SHEET. (30 points)
Text 1
It is all very well to blame traffic jams, the cost of petrol and the quick pace of modern 

life, but manners on the roads are becoming horrible. Everybody knows that the nicest men 

become monsters behind the wheel. It is very well, again, to have a tiger in the tank, but 

to have one in the driver¡¯s seat is another matter altogether. You might tolerate the odd 

road-hog, the rude and inconsiderate driver, but nowadays the well-mannered motorist is 

the exception to the rule. Perhaps the situation calls for a ¡®Be Kind to Other Drivers¡¯ 

campaign, otherwise it may get completely out of hand.
Road politeness is not only good manners, but good sense too. It takes the most cool-

headed and good-tempered of drivers to resist the temptation to revenge when subjected to 

uncivilized behavior. On the other hand, a little politeness goes a long way towards 

relieving the tensions of motoring. A friendly nod or a wave of acknowledgement in 

response to an act of politeness helps to create an atmosphere of goodwill and tolerance 

so necessary in modern traffic conditions. But such acknowledgements of politeness are all 

too rare today. Many drivers nowadays don¡¯t even seem able to recognize politeness when 

they see it.
However, misplaced politeness can also be dangerous. Typical examples are the driver who 

brakes violently to allow a car to emerge from a side street at some hazard to following 

traffic, when a few seconds later the road would be clear anyway; or the man who waves a 

child across a zebra crossing into the path of oncoming vehicles that may be unable to 

stop in time. The same goes for encouraging old ladies to cross the road wherever and 

whenever they care to. It always amazes me that the highways are not covered with the dead 

bodies of these grannies.
A veteran driver, whose manners are faultless, told me it would help if motorists learnt 

to filter correctly into traffic streams one at a time without causing the total blockages 

that give rise to bad temper. Unfortunately, modern motorists can¡¯t even learn to drive, 

let alone master the subtler aspects of boatmanship. Years ago the experts warned us that 

the car-ownership explosion would demand a lot more give-and-take from all road users. It 

is high time for all of us to take this message to heart.
31.	According to this passage, troubles on the road are primarily caused by ________.
[A] people¡¯s attitude towards the road-hog
[B] the rhythm of modern life
[C] the behavior of the driver
[D] traffic conditions
32.	The sentence ¡°You might tolerate the odd road-hog... the rule.¡± (Para. 1) 

implies that ________.
[A] our society is unjust towards well-mannered motorists
[B] rude drivers can be met only occasionally
[C] the well-mannered motorist cannot tolerate the road-hog
[D] nowadays impolite drivers constitute the majority of motorists
33.	By ¡°good sense,¡± the writer means ________.
[A] the driver¡¯s ability to understand and react reasonably
[B] the driver¡¯s prompt response to difficult and severe conditions
[C] the driver¡¯s tolerance of rude or even savage behavior
[D] the driver¡¯s acknowledgement of politeness and regulations
34.	Experts have long pointed out that in the face of car-ownership explosion, 

________.
[A] road users should make more sacrifice
[B] drivers should be ready to yield to each other
[C] drivers should have more communication among themselves
[D] drivers will suffer great loss if they pay no respect to others
35.	In the writer¡¯s opinion, ________.
[A] strict traffic regulations are badly needed
[B] drivers should apply road politeness properly
[C] rude drivers should be punished
[D] drivers should avoid traffic jams

In the atmosphere, carbon dioxide acts rather like a one-way mirror -- the glass in the 

roof of a greenhouse which allows the sun¡¯s rays to enter but prevents the heat from 

escaping.
According to a weather expert¡¯s prediction, the atmosphere will be 3¡æ warmer in the year 

2050 than it is today, if man continues to burn fuels at the present rate. If this warming 

up took place, the ice caps in the poles would begin to melt, thus raising sea level 

several metres and severely flooding coastal cities. Also, the increase in atmospheric 

temperature would lead to great changes in the climate of the northern hemisphere, 

possibly resulting in an alteration of earth¡¯s chief food-growing zones.
In the past, concern about a man-made warming of the earth has concentrated on the Arctic 

because the Antarctic is much colder and has a much thicker ice sheet. But the weather 

experts are now paying more attention to West Antarctic, which may be affected by only a 

few degrees of warming, in other words, by a warming on the scale that will possibly take 

place in the next fifty years from the burning of fuels.
Satellite pictures show that large areas of Antarctic ice are already disappearing. The 

evidence available suggests that a warming has taken place. This fits the theory that 

carbon dioxide warms the earth.
However, most of the fuel is burnt in the northern hemisphere, where temperatures seem to 

be falling. Scientists conclude, therefore, that up to now natural influences on the 

weather have exceeded those caused by man. The question is: Which natural cause has most 

effect on the weather?
One possibility is the variable behavior of the sun. Astronomers at one research station 

have studied the hot spots and ¡°cold¡± spots (that is, the relatively less hot spots) on 

the sun. As the sun rotates, every 27.5 days, it presents hotter or ¡°colder¡± faces to 

the earth, and different aspects to different parts of the earth. This seems to have a 

considerable effect on the distribution of the earth¡¯s atmospheric pressure, and 

consequently on wind circulation. The sun is also variable over a long term: its heat 

output goes up and down in cycles, the latest trend being downward.
Scientists are now finding mutual relations between models of solar-weather interactions 

and the actual climate over many thousands of years, including the last Ice Age. The 

problem is that the models are predicting that the world should be entering a new Ice Age 

and it is not. One way of solving this theoretical difficulty is to assume a delay of 

thousands of years while the solar effects overcome the inertia (¹ßÐÔ) of the earth¡¯s 

climate. If this is right, the warming effect of carbon dioxide might thus be serving as a 

useful counter-balance to the sun¡¯s diminishing heat.
36.	It can be concluded that a concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would 

________.
[A] prevent the sun¡¯s rays from leeching the earth¡¯s surface
[B] mean a warming up in the Arctic
[C] account for great changes in the climate in the northern hemisphere
[D] raise the temperature of the earth¡¯s surface
37.	The article was written to explain ________.
[A] the greenhouse effect
[B] the solar effects on the earth
[C] the models of solar-weather interactions
[D] the causes affecting weather
38.	Although the fuel consumption is greater in the northern hemisphere, temperatures 

there seem to be falling. This is ________.
[A] mainly because the levels of carbon dioxide are rising
[B] possibly because the ice caps in the poles are melting
[C] exclusively due to the effect of the inertia of the earth¡¯s climate
[D] partly due to variations in the output of solar energy
39.	On the basis of their models, scientists are of the opinion that ________.
[A] the climate of the world should be becoming cooler
[B] it will take thousands of years for the inertia of the earth¡¯s climate to take effect
[C] the man-made warming effect helps to increase the solar effects
[D] the new Ice Age will be delayed by the greenhouse effect
40.	If the assumption about the delay of a new Ice Age is correct, ________.
[A] the best way to overcome the cooling effect would be to burn more fuels
[B] ice would soon cover the northern hemisphere
[C] the increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could warm up the earth even 

more quickly
[D] the greenhouse effect could work to the advantage of the earth
Text 3
Some people believe that international sport creates goodwill between the nations and that 

if countries play games together they will learn to live together. Others say that the 

opposite is true: that international contests encourage false national pride and lead to 

misunderstanding and hatred. There is probably some truth in both arguments, but in recent 

years the Olympic Games have done little to support the view that sports encourages 

international brotherhood. Not only was there the tragic incident involving the murder of 

athletes, but the Games were also ruined by lesser incidents caused principally by minor 

national contests.
One country received its second-place medals with visible indignation after the hockey final. There had been noisy scenes at the end of the hockey match, the losers 

objecting to the final decisions. They were convinced that one of their goals should not 

have been disallowed and that their opponents¡¯ victory was unfair. Their manager was in a 

rage when he said: ¡°This wasn¡¯t hockey. Hockey and the International Hockey Federation 

are finished.¡± The president of the Federation said later that such behavior could result 

in the suspension of the team for at least three years.
The American basketball team announced that they would not yield first place to Russia, 

after a disputable end to their contest. The game had ended in disturbance. It was thought 

at first that the United States had won, by a single point, but it was announced that 

there were three seconds still to play. A Russian player then threw the ball from one end 

of the court to the other, and another player popped it into the basket. It was the first 

time the USA had ever lost an Olympic basketball match. An appeal jury debated the matter 

for four and a half hours before announcing that the result would stand. The American 

players then voted not to receive the silver medals.
Incidents of this kind will continue as long as sport is played competitively rather than 

for the love of the game. The suggestion that athletes should compete as individuals, or 

in non-national teams, might be too much to hope for. But in the present organization of 

the Olympics there is far too much that encourages aggressive patriotism.
41.	According to the author, recent Olympic Games have ________.
[A] created goodwill between the nations
[B] bred only false national pride
[C] barely showed any international friendship
[D] led to more and more misunderstanding and hatred
42.	What did the manager mean by saying, ¡°... Hockey and the International Hockey 

Federation are finished¡±?
[A] His team would no longer take part in international games.
[B] Hockey and the Federation are both ruined by the unfair decisions.
[C] There should be no more hockey matches organized by the Federation.
[D] The Federation should be dissolved.
43.	The basketball example implied that ________.
[A] too much patriotism was displayed in the incident
[B] the announcement to prolong the match was wrong
[C] the appeal jury was too hesitant in making the decision
[D] the American team was right in rejecting the silver medals
44.	The author gives the two examples in paragraphs 2 and 3 to show ________.
[A] how false national pride led to undesirable incidents in international games
[B] that sportsmen have been more obedient than they used to be
[C] that competitiveness in the games discourages international friendship
[D] that unfair decisions are common in Olympic Games
45.	What conclusion can be drawn from the passage?
[A] The organization of the Olympic Games must be improved.
[B] Athletes should compete as individual in the Olympic Games.
[C] Sport should be played competitively rather than for the love of the game.
[D] International contests are liable for misunderstanding between nations.

Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into

Intelligence at best is an assumptive construct -- the meaning of the word has never been 

clear. (71) There is more agreement on the kinds of behavior referred to by the term than 

there is on how to interpret or classify them. But it is generally agreed that a person of 

high intelligence is one who can grasp ideas readily, make distinctions, reason logically, 

and make use of verbal and mathematical symbols in solving problems. An intelligence test 

is a rough measure of a child¡¯s capacity for learning, particularly for learning the 

kinds of things required in school. It does not measure character, social adjustment, 

physical endurance, manual skills, or artistic abilities. It is not supposed to -- it was 

not designed for such purposes. (72) To criticize it for such failure is roughly 

comparable to criticizing a thermometer for not measuring wind velocity.
The other thing we have to notice is that the assessment of the intelligence of any 

subject is essentially a comparative affair.
(73) Now since the assessment of intelligence is a comparative matter we must be sure that 

the scale with which we are comparing our subjects provides a ¡®valid¡¯ or ¡®fair¡¯ 

comparison. It is here that some of the difficulties which interest us begin. Any test 

performed involves at least three factors: the intention to do one¡¯s best, the knowledge 

required for understanding what you have to do, and the intellectual ability to do it. 

(74) The first two must be equal for all who are being compared, if any comparison in 

terms of intelligence is to be made. In school populations in our culture these 

assumptions can be made fair and reasonable, and the value of intelligence testing has 

been proved thoroughly. Its value lies, of course, in its providing a satisfactory basis 

for prediction. No one is in the least interested in the marks a little child gets on his 

test; what we are interested in is whether we can conclude from his mark on the test that 

the child will do better or worse than other children of his age at tasks which we think 

require ¡®general intelligence¡¯.
(75) On the whole such a conclusion can be drawn with a certain degree of confidence, but 

only if the child can be assumed to have had the same attitude towards the test as the 

others with whom he is being compared, and only if he was not punished by lack of relevant 

information which they possessed.

For A Better Understanding Between Parent And Child
Nowadays, there is often a lack of understanding between parent and child. One generation 

often feels that its style of life is different from another generation¡¯s style. The 

feeling that each family unit should have a separate residence is characteristic. No one 

wants to intrude or be intruded upon. Both parents and child feel that the other¡¯s 

presence would upset and change the normal routine.
One of the reasons for present situation is that there are different likes and dislikes 

between parents and child. For example, the child likes glittering disco, rock-and-roll 

music or loves movies for his entertainment at night while the parents like peaceful 

environment and physical exercises. They would like to spend their evenings of life in 

happiness.
Secondly, there often exists misunderstanding between parent and child. The child doesn¡¯t 

know what his parent thinks and acts, while the parent doesn¡¯t understand what his 

children want to do. In general, young people enjoy a great deal of freedom, while their 

parents always keep their traditional style of life.
Thirdly, children often do not feel an equal share of responsibility toward their parents. 

For example, a brother sometimes feels that his sisters are responsible for physical care 

of their parents. One child may resent another¡¯s reluctance to help, provoking 

misunderstanding and bitterness. Not all of the children may be financially capable of 

contributing an equal share to the cost of their parent¡¯s care.
I argue that it is unfair to say that they are self-centered. Parent and child should 

often communicate each other. By discovering things about both sides, they can interact 

much better and help each other to deal with their problems for a better understanding 

between parents and child.

Text 1
Is language, like food, a basic human need without which a child at a critical period of 

life can be starved and damaged? Judging from the drastic experiment of Frederick II in 

the thirteenth century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if 

he heard no mother tongue, he told the nurses to keep silent.
All the infants died before the first year. But clearly there was more than lack of 

language here. What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first 

year of life especially, the capacity to survive is seriously affected.
Today no such severe lack exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children 

are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is 

insensitive to the signals of the infant, whose brain is programmed to learn language 

rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills 

passes and they might never be learned so easily again. A bird learns to sing and to fly 

rapidly at the right time, but the process is slow and hard once the critical stage has 

passed.
Experts suggest that speech stages are reached in a fixed sequence and at a constant age, 

but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to 

be of high IQ. At twelve weeks a baby smiles and makes vowel-like sounds; at twelve months 

he can speak simple words and understand simple commands; at eighteen months he has a 

vocabulary of three to fifty words. At three he knows about 1,000 words which he can put 

into sentences, and at four his language differs from that of his parents in style rather 

than grammar.
Recent evidence suggests that an infant is born with the capacity to speak. What is 

special about man¡¯s brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which 

enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a toy-bear with the sound pattern 

¡°toy-bear.¡± And even more incredible is the young brain¡¯s ability to pick out an order 

in language from the mixture of sound around him, to analyze, to combine and recombine the 

parts of a language in new ways.
But speech has to be induced, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the 

child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the child¡¯s babbling , 

grasping and smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals 

dulls the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious 

signals. Sensitivity to the child¡¯s non-verbal signals is essential to the growth and 

development of language.
31.	The purpose of Frederick II¡¯s experiment was ________.
[A] to prove that children are born with the ability to speak
[B] to discover what language a child would speak without hearing any human speech
[C] to find out what role careful nursing would play in teaching a child to speak
[D] to prove that a child could be damaged without learning a language
32.	The reason some children are backward in speaking is most probably that ________.
[A] they are incapable of learning language rapidly
[B] they are exposed to too much language at once
[C] their mothers respond inadequately to their attempts to speak
[D] their mothers are not intelligent enough to help them
33.	What is exceptionally remarkable about a child is that ________.
[A] he is born with the capacity to speak
[B] he has a brain more complex than an animal¡¯s
[C] he can produce his own sentences
[D] he owes his speech ability to good nursing
34.	Which of the following can NOT be inferred from the passage?
[A] The faculty of speech is inborn in man.
[B] Encouragement is anything but essential to a child in language learning.
[C] The child¡¯s brain is highly selective.
[D] Most children learn their language in definite stages.
35.	If a child starts to speak later than others, he will ________.
[A] have a high IQ
[B] be less intelligent
[C] be insensitive to verbal signals
[D] not necessarily be backward
Text 2
In general, our society is becoming one of giant enterprises directed by a bureaucratic management in which man becomes a small, well-oiled cog in the machinery. The 

oiling is done with higher wages, well-ventilated factories and piped music, and by 

psychologists and ¡°human-relations¡± experts; yet all this oiling does not alter the fact 

that man has become powerless, that he does not wholeheartedly participate in his work and 

that he is bored with it. In fact, the blue- and the white-collar workers have become 

economic puppets who dance to the tune of automated machines and bureaucratic management.
The worker and employee are anxious, not only because they might find themselves out of a 

job; they are anxious also because they are unable to acquire any real satisfaction or 

interest in life. They live and die without ever having confronted the fundamental 

realities of human existence as emotionally and intellectually independent and productive 

human beings.
Those higher up on the social ladder are no less anxious. Their lives are no less empty 

than those of their subordinates. They are even more insecure in some respects. They are 

in a highly competitive race. To be promoted or to fall behind is not a matter of salary 

but even more a matter of self-respect. When they apply for their first job, they are 

tested for intelligence as well as for the tight mixture of submissiveness and 

independence. From that moment on they are tested again and again -- by the psychologists, 

for whom testing is a big business, and by their superiors, who judge their behavior, 

sociability, capacity to get along, etc. This constant need to prove that one is as good 

as or better than one¡¯s fellow-competitor creates constant anxiety and stress, the very 

causes of unhappiness and illness.
Am I suggesting that we should return to the preindustrial mode of production or to 

nineteenth-century ¡°free enterprise¡± capitalism? Certainly not. Problems are never 

solved by returning to a stage which one has already outgrown. I suggest transforming our 

social system from a bureaucratically managed industrialism in which maximal production 

and consumption are ends in themselves into a humanist industrialism in which man and full 

development of his potentialities -- those of love and of reason -- are the aims of all 

social arrangements. Production and consumption should serve only as means to this end, 

and should be prevented from ruling man.
36.	By ¡°a well-oiled cog in the machinery¡± the author intends to render the idea 

that man is ________.
[A] a necessary part of the society though each individual¡¯s function is negligible
[B] working in complete harmony with the rest of the society
[C] an unimportant part in comparison with the rest of the society, though functioning 

smoothly
[D] a humble component of the society, especially when working smoothly
37.	The real cause of the anxiety of the workers and employees is that ________.
[A] they are likely to lose their jobs
[B] they have no genuine satisfaction or interest in life
[C] they are faced with the fundamental realities of human existence
[D] they are deprived of their individuality and independence
38.	From the passage we can infer that real happiness of life belongs to those 

________.
[A] who are at the bottom of the society
[B] who are higher up in their social status
[C] who prove better than their fellow-competitors
[D] who could keep far away from this competitive world
39.	To solve the present social problems the author suggests that we should ________.
[A] resort to the production mode of our ancestors
[B] offer higher wages to the workers and employees
[C] enable man to fully develop his potentialities
[D] take the fundamental realities for granted
40.	The author¡¯s attitude towards industrialism might best be summarized as one of 

________.
[A] approval
[B] dissatisfaction
[C] suspicion
[D] tolerance
Text 3
When an invention is made, the inventor has three possible courses of action open to him: 

he can give the invention to the world by publishing it, keep the idea secret, or patent 

it.
A granted patent is the result of a bargain struck between an inventor and the state, by 

which the inventor gets a limited period of monopoly and publishes full details of 

his invention to the public after that period terminates.
Only in the most exceptional circumstances is the lifespan of a patent extended to alter 

this normal process of events.
The longest extension ever granted was to Georges Valensi; his 1939 patent for color TV 

receiver circuitry was extended until 1971 because for most of the patent¡¯s normal life 

there was no colour TV to receive and thus no hope of reward for the invention. 
Because a patent remains permanently public after it has terminated, the shelves of the 

library attached to the patent office contain details of literally millions of ideas that 

are free for anyone to use and, if older than half a century, sometimes even re-patent. 

Indeed, patent experts often advise anyone wishing to avoid the high cost of conducting a 

search through live patents that the one sure way of avoiding violation of any other 

inventor¡¯s right is to plagiarize a dead patent.
Likewise, because publication of an idea in any other form permanently invalidates further 

patents on that idea, it is traditionally safe to take ideas from other areas of print. 

Much modern technological advance is based on these presumptions of legal security.
Anyone closely involved in patents and inventions soon learns that most ¡°new¡± ideas are, 

in fact, as old as the hills. It is their reduction to commercial practice, either through 

necessity or dedication, or through the availability of new technology, that makes news 

and money. The basic patent for the theory of magnetic recording dates back to 1886. Many 

of the original ideas behind television originate from the late 19th and early 20th 

century. Even the Volkswagen rear engine car was anticipated by a 1904 patent for a cart 

with the horse at the rear.
41.	The passage is mainly about ________.
[A] an approach to patents
[B] the application for patents
[C] the use of patents
[D] the access to patents
42.	Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?
[A] When a patent becomes out of effect, it can be re-patented or extended if necessary.
[B] It is necessary for an inventor to apply for a patent before he makes his invention 

public.
[C] A patent holder must publicize the details of his invention when its legal period is 

over.
[D] One can get all the details of a patented invention from a library attached to the 

patent office.
43.	George Valensi¡¯s patent lasted until 1971 because ________.
[A] nobody would offer any reward for his patent prior to that time
[B] his patent could not be put to use for an unusually long time
[C] there were not enough TV stations to provide colour programmes
[D] the colour TV receiver was not available until that time
44.	The word ¡°plagiarize¡± (line 8, Para. 5) most probably means ¡°________.¡±
[A] steal and use
[B] give reward to
[C] make public
[D] take and change
45.	From the passage we learn that ________.
[A] an invention will not benefit the inventor unless it is reduced to commercial practice
[B] products are actually inventions which were made a long time ago
[C] it is much cheaper to buy an old patent than a new one
[D] patent experts often recommend patents to others by conducting a search through dead 

patents

Although interior design has existed since the beginning of architecture, its development 

into a specialized field is really quite recent. Interior designers have become important 

partly because of the many functions that might be __46__ in a single large building.
The importance of interior design becomes __47__ when we realize how much time we __48__ 

surrounded by four walls. Whenever we need to be indoors, we want our surroundings to be 

__49__ attractive and comfortable as possible. We also expect __50__ place to be 

appropriate to its use. You would be __51__ if the inside of your bedroom were suddenly 

changed to look __52__ the inside of a restaurant. And you wouldn¡¯t feel __53__ in a 

business office that has the appearance of a school.
It soon becomes clear that the interior designer¡¯s most important basic __54__ is the 

function of the particular __55__. For example, a theater with poor sight lines, poor 

sound-shaping qualities, and __56__ few entries and exits will not work for __57__ 

purpose, no matter how beautifully it might be __58__. Nevertheless, for any kind of 

space, the designer has to make many of the same kind of __59__. He or she must coordinate 

the shapes, lighting and decoration of everything from ceiling to floor. __60__ addition, 

the designer must usually select furniture or design built-in furniture, according to the 

functions that need to be served.

Section V: English-Chinese Translation
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into 

Chinese. (15 points)
(71) The method of scientific investigation is nothing but the expression of the necessary 

mode of working of the human mind; it is simply the mode by which all phenomena are 

reasoned about and given precise and exact explanation. There is no more difference, but 

there is just the same kind of difference, between the mental operations of a man of 

science and those of an ordinary person, as there is between the operations and methods of 

a baker or of a butcher weighing out his goods in common scales, and the operations of a 

chemist in performing a difficult and complex analysis by means of his balance and finely 

graded weights. (72) It is not that the scales in the one case, and the balance in the 

other, differ in the principles of their construction or manner of working; but that the 

latter is a much finer apparatus and of course much more accurate in its measurement than 

the former.
You will understand this better, perhaps, if I give you some familiar examples. (73) You 

have all heard it repeated that men of science work by means of induction (¹éÄÉ·¨) and 

deduction, that by the help of these operations, they, in a sort of sense, manage to 

extract from Nature certain natural laws, and that out of these, by some special skill of 

their own, they build up their theories. (74) And it is imagined by many that the 

operations of the common mind can be by no means compared with these processes, and that 

they have to be acquired by a sort of special training. To hear all these large words, you 

would think that the mind of a man of science must be constituted differently from that of 

his fellow men; but if you will not be frightened by terms, you will discover that you are 

quite wrong, and that all these terrible apparatus are being used by yourselves every day 

and every hour of your lives.
There is a well-known incident in one of Motiere¡¯s plays, where the author makes the hero 

express unbounded delight on being told that he had been talking prose during the 

whole of his life. In the same way, I trust that you will take comfort, and be delighted 

with yourselves, on the discovery that you have been acting on the principles of inductive 

and deductive philosophy during the same period. (75) Probably there is not one here who 

has not in the course of the day had occasion to set in motion a complex train of 

reasoning, of the very same kind, though differing in degree, as that which a scientific 

man goes through in tracing the causes of natural phenomena.

Text 1
The American economic system is organized around a basically private-enterprise, market-

oriented economy in which consumers largely determine what shall be produced by spending 

their money in the marketplace for those goods and services that they want most. Private 

businessmen, striving to make profits, produce these goods and services in competition 

with other businessmen; and the profit motive, operating under competitive pressures, 

largely determines how these goods and services are produced. Thus, in the American 

economic system it is the demand of individual consumers, coupled with the desire of 

businessmen to maximize profits and the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes, 

that together determine what shall be produced and how resources are used to produce it.
An important factor in a market-oriented economy is the mechanism by which consumer 

demands can be expressed and responded to by producers. In the American economy, this 

mechanism is provided by a price system, a process in which prices rise and fall in 

response to relative demands of consumers and supplies offered by seller-producers. If the 

product is in short supply relative to the demand, the price will be bid up and some 

consumers will be eliminated from the market. If, on the other hand, producing more of a 

commodity results in reducing its cost, this will tend to increase the supply offered by 

seller-producers, which in turn will lower the price and permit more consumers to buy the 

product. Thus, price is the regulating mechanism in the American economic system.
The important factor in a private-enterprise economy is that individuals are allowed to 

own productive resources (private property), and they are permitted to hire labor, gain 

control over natural resources, and produce goods and services for sale at a profit. In 

the American economy, the concept of private property embraces not only the ownership of 

productive resources but also certain rights, including the right to determine the price 

of a product or to make a free contract with another private individual.
51.	In Line 11, Paragraph 1, ¡°the desire of individuals to maximize their incomes¡± 

means ________.
[A] Americans are never satisfied with their incomes
[B] Americans tend to overstate their incomes
[C] Americans want to have their incomes increased
[D] Americans want to increase the purchasing power of their incomes
52.	The first two sentences in the second paragraph tell us that ________.
[A] producers can satisfy the consumers by mechanized production
[B] consumers can express their demands through producers
[C] producers decide the prices of products
[D] supply and demand regulate prices
53.	According to the passage, a private-enterprise economy is characterized by 

________.
[A] private property and rights concerned
[B] manpower and natural resources control
[C] ownership of productive resources
[D] free contracts and prices
54.	The passage is mainly about ________.
[A] how American goods are produced
[B] how American consumers buy their goods
[C] how American economic system works
[D] how American businessmen make their profits
Text 2
One hundred and thirteen million Americans have at least one bank-issued credit card. They 

give their owners automatic credit in stores, restaurants, and hotels, at home, across the 

country, and even abroad, and they make many banking services available as well. More and 

more of these credit cards can be read automatically, making it possible to withdraw or 

deposit money in scattered locations, whether or not the local branch bank is open. For 

many of us the ¡°cashless society¡± is not on the horizon -- it¡¯s already here.
While computers offer these conveniences to consumers, they have many advantages for 

sellers too. Electronic cash registers can do much more than simply ring up sales. They 

can keep a wide range of records, including who sold what, when, and to whom. This 

information allows businessmen to keep track of their list of goods by showing which items 

are being sold and how fast they are moving. Decisions to reorder or return goods to 

suppliers can then be made. At the same time these computers record which hours are 

busiest and which employees are the most efficient, allowing personnel and staffing 

assignments to be made accordingly. And they also identify preferred customers for 

promotional campaigns. Computers are relied on by manufacturers for similar reasons. 

Computer-analyzed marketing reports can help to decide which products to emphasize now, 

which to develop for the future, and which to drop. Computers keep track of goods in 

stock, of raw materials on hand, and even of the production process itself.
Numerous other commercial enterprises, from theaters to magazine publishers, from gas and 

electric utilities to milk processors, bring better and more efficient services to 

consumers through the use of computers.
55.	According to the passage, the credit card enables its owner to ________.
[A] withdraw as much money from the bank as he wishes
[B] obtain more convenient services than other people do
[C] enjoy greater trust from the storekeeper
[D] cash money wherever he wishes to
56.	From the last sentence of the first paragraph we learn that ________.
[A] in the future all the Americans will use credit cards
[B] credit cards are mainly used in the United States today
[C] nowadays many Americans do not pay in cash
[D] it is now more convenient to use credit cards than before
57.	The phrase ¡°ring up sales¡± (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably means ¡°________¡±.
[A] make an order of goods
[B] record sales on a cash register
[C] call the sales manager
[D] keep track of the goods in stock
58.	What is this passage mainly about?
[A] Approaches to the commercial use of computers.
[B] Conveniences brought about by computers in business.
[C] Significance of automation in commercial enterprises.
[D] Advantages of credit cards in business.
Text 3
Exceptional children are different in some significant way from others of the same age. 

For these children to develop to their full adult potential, their education must be 

adapted to those differences.
Although we focus on the needs of exceptional children, we find ourselves describing their 

environment as well. While the leading actor on the stage captures our attention, we are 

aware of the importance of the supporting players and the scenery of the play itself. Both 

the family and the society in which exceptional children live are often the key to their 

growth and development. And it is in the public schools that we find the full expression 

of society¡¯s understanding -- the knowledge, hopes, and fears that are passed on to the 

next generation.
Education in any society is a mirror of that society. In that mirror we can see the 

strengths, the weaknesses, the hopes, the prejudices, and the central values of the 

culture itself. The great interest in exceptional children shown in public education over 

the past three decades indicates the strong feeling in our society that all citizens, 

whatever their special conditions, deserve the opportunity to fully develop their 

capabilities.
¡°All men are created equal.¡± We¡¯ve heard it many times, but it still has important 

meaning for education in a democratic society. Although the phrase was used by this 

country¡¯s founders to denote equality before the law, it has also been interpreted to 

mean equality of opportunity. That concept implies educational opportunity for all 

children -- the right of each child to receive help in learning to the limits of his or 

her capacity, whether that capacity be small or great. Recent court decisions have 

confirmed the right of all children -- disabled or not -- to an appropriate education, and 

have ordered that public schools take the necessary steps to provide that education. In 

response, schools are modifying their programs, adapting instruction to children who are 

exceptional, to those who cannot profit substantially from regular programs.
59.	In Paragraph 2, the author cites the example of the leading actor on the stage to 

show that
[A] the growth of exceptional children has much to do with their family and the society
[B] exceptional children are more influenced by their families than normal children are
[C] exceptional children are the key interest of the family and society
[D] the needs of the society weigh much heavier than the needs of the exceptional children
60.	The reason that the exceptional children receive so much concern in education is 

that ________.
[A] they are expected to be leaders of the society
[B] they might become a burden of the society
[C] they should fully develop their potentials
[D] disabled children deserve special consideration
61.	This passage mainly deals with ________.
[A] the differences of children in their learning capabilities
[B] the definition of exceptional children in modern society
[C] the special educational programs for exceptional children
[D] the necessity of adapting education to exceptional children
62.	From this passage we learn that the educational concern for exceptional children 

________.
[A] is now enjoying legal support
[B] disagrees with the tradition of the country
[C] was clearly stated by the country¡¯s founders
[D] will exert great influence over court decisions

¡°I have great confidence that by the end of the decade we¡¯ll know in vast detail how 

cancer cells arise,¡± says microbiologist Robert Weinberg, an expert on cancer. ¡°But,¡± 

he cautions, ¡°some people have the idea that once one understands the causes, the cure 

will rapidly follow. Consider Pasteur, he discovered the causes of many kinds of 

infections, but it was fifty or sixty years before cures were available.¡±
This year, 50 percent of the 910,000 people who suffer from cancer will survive at least 

five years. In the year 2000, the National Cancer Institute estimates, that figure will be 

75 percent. For some skin cancers, the five-year survival rate is as high as 90 percent. 

But other survival statistics are still discouraging -- 13 percent for lung cancer, and 2 

percent for cancer of the pancreas.
With as many as 120 varieties in existence, discovering how cancer works is not easy. The 

researchers made great progress in the early 1970s, when they discovered that oncogenes, 

which are cancer-causing genes, are inactive in normal cells. Anything from cosmic rays to 

radiation to diet may activate a dormant oncogene, but how remains unknown. If several 

oncogenes are driven into action, the cell, unable to turn them off, becomes cancerous.
The exact mechanisms involved are still mysterious, but the likelihood that many cancers 

are initiated at the level of genes suggests that we will never prevent all cancers. 

¡°Changes are a normal part of the evolutionary process,¡± says oncologist William 

Hayward. Environmental factors can never be totally eliminated; as Hayward points out, 

¡°We can¡¯t prepare a medicine against cosmic rays.¡±
The prospects for cure, though still distant, are brighter.
¡°First, we need to understand how the normal cell controls itself. Second, we have to 

determine whether there are a limited number of genes in cells which are always 

responsible for at least part of the trouble. If we can understand how cancer works, we 

can counteract its action.¡±
63.	The example of Pasteur in the passage is used to ________.
[A] predict that the secret of cancer will be disclosed in a decade
[B] indicate that the prospects for curing cancer are bright
[C] prove that cancer will be cured in fifty to sixty years
[D] warn that there is still a long way to go before cancer can be conquered
64.	The author implies that by the year 2000, ________.
[A] there will be a drastic rise in the five-year survival rate of skin-cancer patients
[B] 90 percent of the skin-cancer patients today will still be living
[C] the survival statistics will be fairly even among patients with various cancers
[D] there won¡¯ t be a drastic increase of survival rate of all cancer patients
65.	Oncogenes are cancer-causing genes ________.
[A] that are always in operation in a healthy person
[B] which remain unharmful so long as they are not activated
[C] that can be driven out of normal cells
[D] which normal cells can¡¯t turn off
66.	The word ¡°dormant¡± in the third paragraph most probably means ________.
[A] dead
[B] ever-present
[C] inactive
[D] potential
Text 5
Discoveries in science and technology are thought by ¡°untaught minds¡± to come in 

blinding flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents. Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as 

legend would have it, look at the mold on a piece of cheese and get the idea for 

penicillin there and then. He experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years 

before he made his discovery. Inventions and innovations almost always come out of 

laborious trial and error. Innovation is like soccer; even the best players miss the goal 

and have their shots blocked much more frequently than they score.
The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take most shots at the goal 

-- and so it goes with innovation in any field of activity. The prime difference between 

innovation and others is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work 

consciously on theirs, and they follow them through until they prove practicable or 

otherwise. What ordinary people see as fanciful abstractions, professional innovators see 

as solid possibilities.
¡°Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that there¡¯s no particular virtue in 

doing things the way they have always been done,¡± wrote Rudolph Flesch, a language 

authority. This accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic 

garbage bags and suitcases on wheels that make life more convenient: ¡°How come nobody 

thought of that before?¡±
The creative approach begins with the proposition that nothing is as it appears. 

Innovators will not accept that there is only one way to do anything. Faced with getting 

from A to B, the average person will automatically set out on the best-known and 

apparently simplest route. The innovator will search for alternate courses, which may 

prove easier in the long run and are bound to be more interesting and challenging even if 

they lead to dead ends.
Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer.
67.	What does the author probably mean by ¡°untaught mind¡± in the first paragraph?
[A] A person ignorant of the hard work involved in experimentation.
[B] A citizen of a society that restricts personal creativity.
[C] A person who has had no education.
[D] An individual who often comes up with new ideas by accident.
68.	According to the author, what distinguishes innovators from non-innovators?
[A] The variety of ideas they have.
[B] The intelligence they possess.
[C] The way they deal with problems.
[D] The way they present their findings.
69.	The author quotes Rudolph Flesch in Paragraph 3 because ________.
[A] Rudolph Flesch is the best-known expert in the study of human creativity
[B] the quotation strengthens the assertion that creative individuals look for new ways of 

doing things
[C] the reader is familiar with Rudolph Flesch¡¯s point of view
[D] the quotation adds a new idea to the information previously presented
70.	The phrase ¡°march to a different drummer¡± (the last line of the passage) 

suggests that highly creative individuals are ________.
[A] diligent in pursuing their goals
[B] reluctant to follow common ways of doing things
[C] devoted to the progress of science
[D] concerned about the advance of society

Your translation must be written neatly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
According to the new school of scientists, technology is an overlooked force in expanding 

the horizons of scientific knowledge. (71) Science moves forward, they say, not so much 

through the insights of great men of genius as because of more ordinary things like 

improved techniques and tools. (72) ¡°In short,¡± a leader of the new school contends, 

¡°the scientific revolution, as we call it, was largely the improvement and invention and 

use of a series of instruments that expanded the reach of science in innumerable 

directions.¡± (73) Over the years, tools and technology themselves as a source of 

fundamental innovation have largely been ignored by historians and philosophers of 

science. The modern school that hails technology argues that such masters as Galileo, 

Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, and inventors such as Edison attached great importance to, and 

derived great benefit from, craft information and technological devices of different kinds 

that were usable in scientific experiments.
The centerpiece of the argument of a technology-yes, genius-no advocate was an analysis of 

Galileo¡¯s role at the start of the scientific revolution. The wisdom of the day was 

derived from Ptolemy, an astronomer of the second century, whose elaborate system of the 

sky put Earth at the center of all heavenly motions. (74) Galileo¡¯s greatest glory was 

that in 1609 he was the first person to turn the newly invented telescope on the heavens 

to prove that the planets revolve around the sun rather than around the Earth. But the 

real hero of the story, according to the new school of scientists, was the long evolution 

in the improvement of machinery for making eyeglasses.
Federal policy is necessarily involved in the technology vs. genius dispute. (75) Whether 

the Government should increase the financing of pure science at the expense of technology 

or vice versa often depends on the issue of which is seen as the driving force.

Sleep is divided into periods of so-called REM sleep, characterized by rapid eye movements 

and dreaming, and longer periods of non-REM sleep.  kind of sleep is at all well-

understood, but REM sleep is to serve some restorative function of the brain. The 

purpose of non-REM sleep is even more . The new experiments, such as those  for 

the first time at a recent meeting of the Society for Sleep Research in Minneapolis, 

suggest fascinating explanations  of non-REM sleep.
For example, it has long been known that total sleep  is 100 percent fatal to rats, 

yet,  examination of the dead bodies, the animals look completely normal. A

Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. It serves directly to 

assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable prices, thereby establishing a firm 

home market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By 

drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. By 

helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labour, and is therefore an 

effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without 

advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your 

television license would need to be doubled and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per 

cent more.
And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in 

the products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven Acts of 

Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product 

that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for 

a little while through misleading advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully 

the public has the good sense not to buy the inferior article more than once. If you see 

an article consistently advertised, it is the surest proof I know that the article does 

what is claimed for it, and that it represents good value.
Advertising does more for the material benefit of the community than any other force I can 

think of.
There is one point I feel I ought to touch on. Recently I heard a well-known television 

personality declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than 

informs. He was drawing excessively fine distinctions. Of course advertising seeks to 

persuade.
If its message were confined merely to information -- and that in itself would be 

difficult if not impossible to achieve, for even a detail such as the choice of the colour 

of a shirt is subtly persuasive -- advertising would be so boring that no one would pay 

any attention. But perhaps that is what the well-known television personality wants.
51.	By the first sentence of the passage the author means that ________.
[A] he is fairly familiar with the cost of advertising
[B] everybody knows well that advertising is money consuming
[C] advertising costs money like everything else
[D] it is worthwhile to spend money on advertising
52.	In the passage, which of the following is NOT included in the advantages of 

advertising?
[A] Securing greater fame.
[B] Providing more jobs.
[C] Enhancing living standards.
[D] Reducing newspaper cost.
53.	The author deems that the well-known TV personality is ________.
[A] very precise in passing his judgment on advertising
[B] interested in nothing but the buyers¡¯ attention
[C] correct in telling the difference between persuasion and information
[D] obviously partial in his views on advertising
54.	In the author¡¯s opinion, ________.
[A] advertising can seldom bring material benefit to man by providing information
[B] advertising informs people of new ideas rather than wins them over
[C] there is nothing wrong with advertising in persuading the buyer
[D] the buyer is not interested in getting information from an advertisement

There are two basic ways to see growth: one as a product, the other as a process. People 

have generally viewed personal growth as an external result or product that can easily be 

identified and measured. The worker who gets a promotion, the student whose grades 

improve, the foreigner who learns a new language -- all these are examples of people who 

have measurable results to show for their efforts.
By contrast, the process of personal growth is much more difficult to determine, since by 

definition it is a journey and not the specific signposts or landmarks along the way. The 

process is not the road itself, but rather the attitudes and feelings people have, their 

caution or courage, as they encounter new experiences and unexpected obstacles. In this 

process, the journey never really ends; there are always new ways to experience the world, 

new ideas to try, new challenges to accept.
In order to grow, to travel new roads, people need to have a willingness to take risks, to 

confront the unknown, and to accept the possibility that they may ¡°fail¡± at first. How 

we see ourselves as we try a new way of being is essential to our ability to grow. Do we 

perceive ourselves as quick and curious? If so, then we tend to take more chances and to 

be more open to unfamiliar experiences. Do we think we¡¯re shy and indecisive? Then our 

sense of timidity can cause us to hesitate, to move slowly, and not to take a step until 

we know the ground is safe. Do we think we¡¯re slow to adapt to change or that we¡¯re not 

smart enough to cope with a new challenge? Then we are likely to take a more passive role 

or not try at all.
These feelings of insecurity and self-doubt are both unavoidable and necessary if we are 

to change and grow. If we do not confront and overcome these internal fears and doubts, if 

we protect ourselves too much, then we cease to grow. We become trapped inside a shell of 

our own making.
55.	A person is generally believed to achieve personal growth when ________.
[A] he has given up his smoking habit
[B] he has made great efforts in his work
[C] he is keen on leaning anything new
[D] he has tried to determine where he is on his journey
56.	In the author¡¯s eyes, one who views personal growth as a process would ________.
[A] succeed in climbing up the social ladder
[B] judge his ability to grow from his own achievements
[C] face difficulties and take up challenges
[D] aim high and reach his goal each time
57.	When the author says ¡°a new way of being¡± (Line 2~3, Para. 3) he is referring to 

________.
[A] a new approach to experiencing the world
[B] a new way of taking risks
[C] a new method of perceiving ourselves
[D] a new system of adaptation to change
58.	For personal growth, the author advocates all of the following EXCEPT ________.
[A] curiosity about more chances
[B] promptness in self-adaptation
[C] open-mindedness to new experiences
[D] avoidance of internal fears and doubts
Text 3
In such a changing, complex society formerly simple solutions to informational needs 

become complicated. Many of life¡¯s problems which were solved by asking family members, 

friends or colleagues are beyond the capability of the extended family to resolve. Where 

to turn for expert information and how to determine which expert advice to accept are 

questions facing many people today.
In addition to this, there is the growing mobility of people since World War II. As 

families move away from their stable community, their friends of many years, their 

extended family relationships, the informal flow of information is cut off, and with it 

the confidence that information will be available when needed and will be trustworthy and 

reliable. The almost unconscious flow of information about the simplest aspects of living 

can be cut off. Thus, things once learned subconsciously through the casual communications 

of the extended family must be consciously learned.
Adding to societal changes today is an enormous stockpile of information. The individual 

now has more information available than any generation, and the task of finding that one 

piece of information relevant to his or her specific problem is complicated, time-

consuming and sometimes even overwhelming.
Coupled with the growing quantity of information is the development of technologies which 

enable the storage and delivery of more information with greater speed to more locations 

than has ever been possible before. Computer technology makes it possible to store vast 

amounts of data in machine-readable files, and to program computers to locate specific 

information. Telecommunications developments enable the sending of messages via 

television, radio, and very shortly, electronic mail to bombard people with multitudes of 

messages. Satellites have extended the power of communications to report events at the 

instant of occurrence. Expertise can be shared worldwide through teleconferencing, and 

problems in dispute can be settled without the participants leaving their homes and/or 

jobs to travel to a distant conference site. Technology has facilitated the sharing of 

information and the storage and delivery of information, thus making more information 

available to more people.
In this world of change and complexity, the need for information is of greatest 

importance. Those people who have accurate, reliable up-to-date information to solve the 

day-to-day problems, the critical problems of their business, social and family life, will 

survive and succeed. ¡°Knowledge is power¡± may well be the truest saying and access to 

information may be the most critical requirement of all people.
59.	The word ¡°it¡± (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably refers to ________.
[A] the lack of stable communities
[B] the breakdown of informal information channels
[C] the increased mobility of families
[D] the growing number of people moving from place to place
60.	The main problem people may encounter today arises from the fact that ________.
[A] they have to learn new things consciously
[B] they lack the confidence of securing reliable and trustworthy information
[C] they have difficulty obtaining the needed information readily
[D] they can hardly carry out casual communications with an extended family
61.	From the passage we can infer that ________.
[A] electronic mail will soon play a dominant role in transmitting messages
[B] it will become more difficult for people to keep secrets in an information era
[C] people will spend less time holding meetings or conferences
[D] events will be reported on the spot mainly through satellites
62.	We can learn from the last paragraph that ________.
[A] it is necessary to obtain as much knowledge as possible
[B] people should make the best use of the information accessible
[C] we should realize the importance of accumulating information
[D] it is of vital importance to acquire needed information efficiently
Text 4
Personality is to a large extent inherent -- A-type parents usually bring about A-type 

offspring. But the environment must also have a profound effect, since if competition is 

important to the parents, it is likely to become a major factor in the lives of their 

children.
One place where children soak up A-characteristics is school, which is, by its very 

nature, a highly competitive institution. Too many schools adopt the ¡°win at all costs¡± 

moral standard and measure their success by sporting achievements. The current passion for 

making children compete against their classmates or against the clock produces a two-layer 

system, in which competitive A-types seem in some way better than their B-type fellows. 

Being too keen to win can have dangerous consequences: remember that Pheidippides, the 

first marathon runner, dropped dead seconds after saying: ¡°Rejoice, we conquer!¡±
By far the worst form of competition in schools is the disproportionate emphasis on 

examinations. It is a rare school that allows pupils to concentrate on those things they 

do well. The merits of competition by examination are somewhat questionable, but 

competition in the certain knowledge of failure is positively harmful.
Obviously, it is neither practical nor desirable that all A youngsters change into B¡¯s. 

The world needs A types, and schools have an important duty to try to fit a child¡¯s 

personality to his possible future employment. It is top management.
If the preoccupation of schools with academic work was lessened, more time might be spent 

teaching children surer values. Perhaps selection for the caring professions, especially 

medicine, could be made less by good grades in chemistry and more by such considerations 

as sensitivity and sympathy. It is surely a mistake to choose our doctors exclusively from 

A-type stock. B¡¯s are important and should be encouraged.
63.	According to the passage, A-type individuals are usually ________.
[A] impatient
[B] considerate
[C] aggressive
[D] agreeable
64.	The author is strongly opposed to the practice of examinations at schools because 

________.
[A] the pressure is too great on the students
[B] some students are bound to fail
[C] failure rates are too high
[D] the results of exanimations are doubtful
65.	The selection of medical professionals is currently based on ________.
[A] candidates¡¯ sensitivity
[B] academic achievements
[C] competitive spirit
[D] surer values
66.	From the passage we can draw the conclusion that ________.
[A] the personality of a child is well established at birth
[B] family influence dominates the shaping of one¡¯s characteristics
[C] the development of one¡¯s personality is due to multiple factors
[D] B-type characteristics can find no place in competitive society
Text 5
That experiences influence subsequent behaviour is evidence of an obvious but nevertheless 

remarkable activity called remembering. Learning could not occur without the function 

popularly named memory. Constant practice has such an effect on memory as to lead to 

skillful performance on the piano, to recitation of a poem, and even to reading and 

understanding these words. So-called intelligent behaviour demands memory, remembering 

being a primary requirement for reasoning. The ability to solve any problem or even to 

recognize that a problem exists depends on memory. Typically, the decision to cross a 

street is based on remembering many earlier experiences.
Practice (or review) tends to build and maintain memory for a task or for any learned 

material. Over a period of no practice what has been learned tends to be forgotten; and 

the adaptive consequences may not seem obvious. Yet, dramatic instances of sudden 

forgetting can be seen to be adaptive. In this sense, the ability to forget can be 

interpreted to have survived through a process of natural selection in animals. Indeed, 

when one¡¯s memory of an emotionally painful experience lead to serious anxiety, 

forgetting may produce relief. Nevertheless, an evolutionary interpretation might make it 

difficult to understand how the commonly gradual process of forgetting survived natural 

selection.
In thinking about the evolution of memory together with all its possible aspects, it is 

helpful to consider what would happen if memories failed to fade. Forgetting clearly aids 

orientation in time, since old memories weaken and the new tend to stand out, providing 

clues for inferring duration. Without forgetting, adaptive ability would suffer, for 

example, learned behaviour that might have been correct a decade ago may no longer be. 

Cases are recorded of people who (by ordinary standards) forgot so little that their 

everyday activities were full of confusion. Thus forgetting seems to serve that survival 

of the individual and the species.
Another line of thought assumes a memory storage system of limited capacity that provides 

adaptive flexibility specifically through forgetting. In this view, continual adjustments 

are made between learning or memory storage (input) and forgetting (output). Indeed, there 

is evidence that the rate at which individuals forget is directly related to how much they 

have learned. Such data offer gross support of contemporary models of memory that assume 

an input-output balance.
67.	From the evolutionary point of view, ________.
[A] forgetting for lack of practice tends to be obviously inadaptive
[B] if a person gets very forgetful all of a sudden he must be very adaptive
[C] the gradual process of forgetting is an indication of an individual¡¯s adaptability
[D] sudden forgetting may bring about adaptive consequences
68.	According to the passage, if a person never forgot, ________.
[A] he would survive best
[B] he would have a lot of trouble
[C] his ability to learn would be enhanced
[D] the evolution of memory would stop
69.	From the last paragraph we know that ________.
[A] forgetfulness is a response to learning
[B] the memory storage system is an exactly balanced input-output system
[C] memory is a compensation for forgetting
[D] the capacity of a memory storage system is limited because forgetting occurs
70.	In this article, the author tries to interpret the function of ________.
[A] remembering
[B] forgetting
[C] adapting
[D] experiencing
Section IV	English-Chinese Translation
Directions:
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into 

Chinese. Your translation must be written neatly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
The standardized educational or psychological tests that are widely used to aid in 

selecting, classifying, assigning, or promoting students, employees, and military 

personnel have been the target of recent attacks in books, magazines, the daily press, and 

even in Congress. 71) The target is wrong, for in attacking the tests, critics divert 

attention from the fault that lies with ill-informed or incompetent users. The tests 

themselves are merely tools, with characteristics that can be measured with reasonable 

precision under specified conditions. Whether the results will be valuable, meaningless, 

or even misleading depends partly upon the tool itself but largely upon the user.
All informed predictions of future performance are based upon some knowledge of relevant 

past performance: school grades, research productivity, sales records, or whatever is 

appropriate. 72) How well the predictions will be validated by later performance depends 

upon the amount, reliability, and appropriateness of the information used and on the skill 

and wisdom with which it is interpreted. Anyone who keeps careful score knows that the 

information available is always incomplete and that the predictions are always subject to 

error.
Standardized tests should be considered in this context. They provide a quick, objective 

method of getting some kinds of information about what a person learned, the skills he has 

developed, or the kind of person he is. The information so obtained has, qualitatively, 

the same advantages and shortcomings as other kinds of information. 73) Whether to use 

tests, other kinds of information, or both in a particular situation depends, therefore, 

upon the evidence from experience concerning comparative validity and upon such factors as 

cost and availability.
74) In general, the tests work most effectively when the qualities to be measured can be 

most precisely defined and least effectively when what is to be measured or predicted 

cannot be well defined. Properly used, they provide a rapid means of getting comparable 

information about many people. Sometimes they identify students whose high potential has 

not been previously recognized, but there are many things they do not do. 75) For example, 

they do not compensate for gross social inequality, and thus do not tell how able an 

underprivileged youngster might have been had he grown up under more favorable 

circumstances.

Tight-lipped elders used to say, ¡°It¡¯s not what you want in this world, but what you 

get.¡±
Psychology teaches that you do get what you want if you know what you want and want the 

right things.
You can make a mental blueprint of a desire as you would make a blueprint of a house, and 

each of us is continually making these blueprints in the general routine of everyday 

living. If we intend to have friends to dinner, we plan the menu, make a shopping list, 

decide which food to cook first, and such planning is an essential for any type of meal to 

be served.
Likewise, if you want to find a job, take a sheet of paper, and write a brief account of 

yourself. In making a blueprint for a job, begin with yourself, for when you know exactly 

what you have to offer, you can intelligently plan where to sell your services.
This account of yourself is actually a sketch of your working life and should include 

education, experience and references. Such an account is valuable. It can be referred to 

in filling out standard application blanks and is extremely helpful in personal 

interviews. While talking to you, your could-be employer is deciding whether your 

education, your experience, and other qualifications, will pay him to employ you and your 

¡°wares¡± and abilities must be displayed in an orderly and reasonably connected manner.
When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you have 

something tangible to sell. Then you are ready to hunt for a job. Get all the possible 

information about your could-be job. Make inquiries as to the details regarding the job 

and the firm. Keep your eyes and ears open, and use your own judgment. Spend a certain 

amount of time each day seeking the employment you wish for, and keep in mind: Securing a 

job is your job now.
51.	What do the elders mean when they say, ¡°It¡¯s not what you want in this world, 

but what you get.¡±?
[A] You¡¯ll certainly get what you want.
[B] It¡¯s no use dreaming.
[C] You should be dissatisfied with what you have.
[D] It¡¯s essential to set a goal for yourself.
52.	A blueprint made before inviting a friend to dinner is used in this passage as 

________.
[A] an illustration of how to write an application for a job
[B] an indication of how to secure a good job
[C] a guideline for job description
[D] a principle for job evaluation
53.	According to the passage, one must write an account of himself before starting to 

find a job because ________.
[A] that is the first step to please the employer
[B] that is the requirement of the employer
[C] it enables him to know when to sell his services
[D] it forces him to become clearly aware of himself
54.	When you have carefully prepared a blueprint of your abilities and desires, you 

have something ________.
[A] definite to offer
[B] imaginary to provide
[C] practical to supply
[D] desirable to present

With the start of BBC World Service Television, millions of viewers in Asia and America 

can now watch the Corporation¡¯s news coverage, as well as listen to it.
And of course in Britain listeners and viewers can tune in to two BBC television channels, 

five BBC national radio services and dozens of local radio stations. They are brought 

sport, comedy, drama, music, news and current affairs, education, religion, parliamentary 

coverage, children¡¯s programmes and films for an annual license fee of ¡ê83 per 

household.
It is a remarkable record, stretching back over 70 years -- yet the BBC¡¯s future is now 

in doubt. The Corporation will survive as a publicly-funded broadcasting organization, at 

least for the time being, but its role, its size and its programmes are now the subject of 

a nation-wide debate in Britain.
The debate was launched by the Government, which invited anyone with an opinion of the BBC 

-- including ordinary listeners and viewers -- to say what was good or bad about the 

Corporation, and even whether they thought it was worth keeping. The reason for its 

inquiry is that the BBC¡¯s royal charter runs out in 1996 and it must decide whether to 

keep the organization as it is, or to make changes.
Defenders of the Corporation -- of whom there are many -- are fond of quoting the American 

slogan ¡°If it ain¡¯t broke, don¡¯t fix it.¡± The BBC ¡°ain¡¯t broke,¡± they say, by which 

they mean it is not broken (as distinct from the word ¡®broke¡¯, meaning having no money), 

so why bother to change it?
Yet the BBC will have to change, because the broadcasting world around it is changing. The 

commercial TV channels ¨C ITV and Channel 4 -- were required by the Thatcher Government¡¯s 

Broadcasting Act to become more commercial, competing with each other for advertisers, and 

cutting costs and jobs. But it is the arrival of new satellite channels -- funded partly 

by advertising and partly by viewers¡¯ subscriptions -- which will bring about the biggest 

changes in the long term.
55.	The world famous BBC now faces ________.
[A] the problem of new coverage
[B] an uncertain prospect
[C] inquiries by the general public
[D] shrinkage of audience
56.	In the passage, which of the following about the BBC is NOT mentioned as the key 

issue?
[A] Extension of its TV service to Far East.
[B] Programmes as the subject of a nation-wide debate.
[C] Potentials for further international cooperations.
[D] Its existence as a broadcasting organization.
57.	The BBC¡¯s ¡°royal charter¡± (Line 4, Paragraph 4) stands for ________.
[A] the financial support from the royal family
[B] the privileges granted by the Queen
[C] a contract with the Queen
[D] a unique relationship with the royal family
58.	The foremost reason why the BBC has to readjust itself is no other than ________.
[A] the emergence of commercial TV channels
[B] the enforcement of Broadcasting Act by the government
[C] the urgent necessity to reduce costs and jobs
[D] the challenge of new satellite channels
Text 3
In the last half of the nineteenth century ¡°capital¡± and ¡°labour¡± were enlarging and 

perfecting their rival organizations on modern lines. Many an old firm was replaced by a 

limited liability company with a bureaucracy of salaried managers. The change met the 

technical requirements of the new age by engaging a large professional element and 

prevented the decline in efficiency that so commonly spoiled the fortunes of family firms 

in the second and third generation after the energetic founders. It was moreover a step 

away from individual initiative, towards collectivism and municipal and state-owned 

business. The railway companies, though still private business managed for the benefit of 

shareholders, were very unlike old family business. At the same time the great 

municipalities went into business to supply lighting, trams and other services to the 

taxpayers.
The growth of the limited liability company and municipal business had important 

consequences. Such large, impersonal manipulation of capital and industry greatly 

increased the numbers and importance of shareholders as a class, an element in national 

life representing irresponsible wealth detached from the land and the duties of the 

landowners; and almost equally detached from the responsible management of business. All 

through the nineteenth century, America, Africa, India, Australia and parts of Europe were 

being developed by British capital, and British shareholders were thus enriched by the 

world¡¯s movement towards industrialization. Towns like Bournemouth and Eastbourne sprang 

up to house large ¡°comfortable¡± classes who had retired on their incomes, and who had no 

relation to the rest of the community except that of drawing dividends and occasionally 

attending a shareholders¡¯ meeting to dictate their orders to the management. On the other 

hand ¡°shareholding¡± meant leisure and freedom which was used by many of the later 

Victorians for the highest purpose of a great civilization.
The ¡°shareholders¡± as such had no knowledge of the lives, thoughts or needs of the 

workmen employed by the company in which he held shares, and his influence on the 

relations of capital and labour was not good. The paid manager acting for the company was 

in more direct relation with the men and their demands, but even he had seldom that 

familiar personal knowledge of the workmen which the employer had often had under the more 

patriarchal system of the old family business now passing away. Indeed the mere size of 

operations and the numbers of workmen involved rendered such personal relations 

impossible. Fortunately, however, the increasing power and organization of the trade 

unions, at least in all skilled trades, enabled the workmen to meet on equal terms the 

managers of the companies who employed them. The cruel discipline of the strike and 

lockout taught the two parties to respect each other¡¯s strength and understand the value 

of fair negotiation.
59.	It¡¯s true of the old family firms that ________.
[A] they were spoiled by the younger generations
[B] they failed for lack of individual initiative
[C] they lacked efficiency compared with modern companies
[D] they could supply adequate services to the taxpayers
60.	The growth of limited liability companies resulted in ________.
[A] the separation of capital from management
[B] the ownership of capital by managers
[C] the emergence of capital and labour as two classes
[D] the participation of shareholders in municipal business
61.	According to the passage, all of the following are true EXCEPT that ________.
[A] the shareholders were unaware of the needs of the workers
[B] the old firm owners had a better understanding of their workers

What accounts for the great outburst of major inventions in early America -- breakthroughs 

such as the telegraph, the steamboat and the weaving machine?
Among the many shaping factors, I would single out the country¡¯s excellent elementary 

schools: a labor force that welcomed the new technology; the practice of giving premiums 

to inventors; and above all the American genius for nonverbal, ¡°spatial¡± thinking about 

things technological.
Why mention the elementary schools? Because thanks to these schools our early mechanics, 

especially in the New England and Middle Atlantic states, were generally literate and at 

home in arithmetic and in some aspects of geometry and trigonometry.
Acute foreign observers related American adaptiveness and inventiveness to this 

educational advantage. As a member of a British commission visiting here in 1853 reported, 

¡°With a mind prepared by thorough school discipline, the American boy develops rapidly 

into the skilled workman.¡±
A further stimulus to invention came from the ¡°premium¡± system, which preceded our 

patent system and for years ran parallel with it. This approach, originated abroad, 

offered inventors medals, cash prizes and other incentives.
In the United States, multitudes of premiums for new devices were awarded at country fairs 

and at the industrial fairs in major cities. Americans flocked to these fairs to admire 

the new machines and thus to renew their faith in the beneficence of technological 

advance.
Given this optimistic approach to technological innovation, the American worker took 

readily to that special kind of nonverbal thinking required in mechanical technology. As 

Eugene Ferguson has pointed out, ¡°A technologist thinks about objects that cannot be 

reduced to unambiguous verbal descriptions: they are dealt with in his mind by a visual, 

nonverbal process... The designer and the inventor... are able to assemble and manipulate 

in their minds devices that as yet do not exist.¡±
This nonverbal ¡°spatial¡± thinking can be just as creative as painting and writing. 

Robert Fulton once wrote, ¡°The mechanic should sit down among levers, screws, wedges, 

wheels, etc., like a poet among the letters of the alphabet, considering them as an 

exhibition of his thoughts, in which a new arrangement transmits a new idea.¡±
When all these shaping forces -- schools, open attitudes, the premium system, a genius for 

spatial thinking -- interacted with one another on the rich U.S. mainland, they produced 

that American characteristic, emulation. Today that word implies mere imitation. But in 

earlier times it meant a friendly but competitive striving for fame and excellence.
63.	According to the author, the great outburst of major inventions in early America 

was in a large part due to ________.
[A] elementary schools
[B] enthusiastic workers
[C] the attractive premium system
[D] a special way of thinking
64.	It is implied that adaptiveness and inventiveness of the early American mechanics 

________.
[A] benefited a lot from their mathematical knowledge
[B] shed light on disciplined school management
[C] was brought about by privileged home training
[D] owed a lot to the technological development
65.	A technologist can be compared to an artist because ________.
[A] they are both winners of awards

[C] they both abandon verbal description
[D] they both use various instruments

Rumor has it that more than 20 books on creationism/evolution are in the publisher¡¯s 

pipelines. A few have already appeared. The goal of all will be to try to explain to a 

confused and often unenlightened citizenry that there are not two equally valid scientific 

theories for the origin and evolution of universe and life. Cosmology, geology, and 

biology have provided a consistent, unified, and constantly improving account of what 

happened. ¡°Scientific¡± creationism, which is being pushed by some for ¡°equal time¡± in 

the classrooms whenever the scientific accounts of evolution are given, is based on 

religion, not science. Virtually all scientists and the majority of non-fundamentalist 

religious leaders have come to regard ¡°scientific¡± creationism as bad science and bad 

religion.
The first four chapters of Kitcher¡¯s book give a very brief introduction to evolution. At 

appropriate places, he introduces the criticisms of the creationists and provides answers. 

In the last three chapters, he takes off his gloves and gives the creationists a good 

beating. He describes their programmes and tactics, and, for those unfamiliar with the 

ways of creationists, the extent of their deception and distortion may come as an 

unpleasant surprise. When their basic motivation is religious, one might have expected 

more Christian behavior.
Kitcher is a philosopher, and this may account, in part, for the clarity and effectiveness 

of his arguments. The non-specialist will be able to obtain at least a notion of the sorts 

of data and argument that support evolutionary theory. The final chapter on the 

creationists will be extremely clear to all. On the dust jacket of this fine book, Stephen 

Jay Gould says: ¡°This book stands for reason itself.¡± And so it does -- and all would be 

well were reason the only judge in the creationism/evolution debate.
67.	¡°Creationism¡± in the passage refers to ________.
[A] evolution in its true sense as to the origin of the universe
[B] a notion of the creation of religion
[C] the scientific explanation of the earth formation
[D] the deceptive theory about the origin of the universe
68.	Kitcher¡¯s book is intended to ________.
[A] recommend the views of the evolutionists
[B] expose the true features of creationists
[C] curse bitterly at this opponents
[D] launch a surprise attack on creationists
69.	From the passage we can infer that ________.
[A] reasoning has played a decisive role in the debate
[B] creationists do not base their argument on reasoning
[C] evolutionary theory is too difficult for non-specialists
[D] creationism is supported by scientific findings
70.	This passage appears to be a digest of ________.
[A] a book review
[B] a scientific paper
[C] a magazine feature
[D] a newspaper editorial
Section IV	English-Chinese Translation
Directions:
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into 

Chinese. Your translation must be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
The differences in relative growth of various areas of scientific research have several 

causes. 71) Some of these causes are completely reasonable results of social needs. Others 

are reasonable consequences of particular advances in science being to some extent self-

accelerating. Some, however, are less reasonable processes of different growth in which 

preconception of the form scientific theory ought to take, by persons in authority, act to 

alter the growth pattern of different areas. This is a new problem probably not yet 

unavoidable; but it is a frightening trend. 72) This trend began during the Second World 

War, when several governments came to the conclusion that the specific demands that a 

government wants to make of its scientific establishment cannot generally be foreseen in 

detail. It can be predicted, however, that from time to time, questions will arise which 

will require specific scientific answers. It is therefore generally valuable to treat the 

scientific establishment as a resource or machine to be kept in functional order. 73) This 

seems mostly effectively done by supporting a certain amount of research not related to 

immediate goals but of possible consequence in the future.
This kind of support, like all government support, requires decisions about the 

appropriate recipients of funds. Decisions based on utility as opposed to lack of utility 

are straightforward. But a decision among projects none of which has immediate utility is 

more difficult. The goal of the supporting agencies is the praisable one of supporting 

¡°good¡± as opposed to ¡°bad¡± science, but a valid determination is difficult to make. 

Generally, the idea of good science tends to become confused with the capacity of the 

field in question to generate an elegant theory. 74) However, the world is so made that 

elegant systems are in principle unable to deal with some of the world¡¯s more fascinating 

and delightful aspects. 75) New forms of thought as well as new subjects for thought must 

arise in the future as they have in the past, giving rise to new standards of elegance.

76.	Directions:
[A] Title: GOOD HEALTH
[B] Time limit: 40 minutes
[C] Word limit: 120-150 words (not including the given opening sentence)
[D] Your composition should be based on the OUTLINE below and should start with the given 

opening sentence: ¡°The desire for good health is universal.¡±
[E] Your composition should be written neatly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
OUTLINE:
1. Importance of good health
2. Ways to keep fit
3. My own practices
 
GOOD HEALTH
Wherever you are and whatever you do, staying healthy is always important. With the 

improvement of our living standards, people are attaching more and more importance to 

their health. We students can¡¯t keep the high study efficiency without good health. The 

same thing is true with workers, scientists and doctors.
In my opinion, good diet and exercises are two major ways to keep healthy. The food we eat 

every day must be rational and should include meat, vegetables, eggs, and fruit. It is 

important to drink water every day and not to get addicted to drinking coffee or some 

other soft drinks. Exercising every day is also essential for us to stay healthy. We can 

ride bicycles, play tennis or swim. Of course we don¡¯t need to exhaust ourselves. We 

should plan our physical exercises according to our actual condition. An hour a day is 

enough.
As a university student, I have much free time to do exercises. I usually play badminton 

and tennis. But sometimes I am lazy and do not exercise for all kinds of excuses, such as 

cold weather and exams. I must correct it. I am also careful with my diet. In a way, 

keeping healthy is not very hard, if you just take it seriously.

It was 3:45 in the morning when the vote was finally taken. After six months of arguing 

and final 16 hours of hot parliamentary debates, Australia¡¯s Northern Territory became 

the first legal authority in the world to allow doctors to take the lives of incurably ill 

patients who wish to die. The measure passed by the convincing vote of 15 to 10. Almost 

immediately word flashed on the Internet and was picked up, half a world away, by John 

Hofsess, executive director of the Right to Die Society of Canada. He sent it on via the 

group¡¯s on-line service, Death NET. Says Hofsess: ¡°We posted bulletins all day long, 

because of course this isn¡¯t just something that happened in Australia. It¡¯s world 

history.¡±
The full import may take a while to sink in. The NT Rights of the Terminally Ill law has 

left physicians and citizens alike trying to deal with its moral and practical 

implications. Some have breathed sighs of relief, others, including churches, right-to-

life groups and the Australian Medical Association, bitterly attacked the bill and the 

haste of its passage. But the tide is unlikely to turn back. In Australia -- where an 

aging population, life-extending technology and changing community attitudes have all 

played their part -- other states are going to consider making a similar law to deal with 

euthanasia. In the US and Canada, where the right-to-die movement is gathering strength, 

observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling.
Under the new Northern Territory law, an adult patient can request death -- probably by a 

deadly injection or pill -- to put an end to suffering. The patient must be diagnosed as 

terminally ill by two doctors. After a ¡°cooling off¡± period of seven days, the patient 

can sign a certificate of request. After 48 hours the wish for death can be met. For Lloyd 

Nickson, a 54-year-old Darwin resident suffering from lung cancer, the NT Rights of 

Terminally Ill law means he can get on with living without the haunting fear of his 

suffering: a terrifying death from his breathing condition. ¡°I¡¯m not afraid of dying 

from a spiritual point of view, but what I was afraid of was how I¡¯d go, because I¡¯ve 

watched people die in the hospital fighting for oxygen and clawing at their masks,¡± he 

says.
51.	From the second paragraph we learn that ________.
[A] the objection to euthanasia is slow to come in other countries
[B] physicians and citizens share the same view on euthanasia
[C] changing technology is chiefly responsible for the hasty passage of the law
[D] it takes time to realize the significance of the law¡¯s passage
52.	When the author says that observers are waiting for the dominoes to start falling, 

he means ________.
[A] observers are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the future of euthanasia
[B] similar bills are likely to be passed in the US, Canada and other countries
[C] observers are waiting to see the result of the game of dominoes
[D] the effect-taking process of the passed bill may finally come to a stop
53.	When Lloyd Nickson dies, he will ________.
[A] face his death with calm characteristic of euthanasia
[B] experience the suffering of a lung cancer patient
[C] have an intense fear of terrible suffering
[D] undergo a cooling off period of seven days
54.	The author¡¯s attitude towards euthanasia seems to be that of ________.
[A] opposition
[B] suspicion
[C] approval
[D] indifference

A report consistently brought back by visitors to the US is how friendly, courteous, and 

helpful most Americans were to them. To be fair, this observation is also frequently made 

of Canada and Canadians, and should best be considered North American. There are, of 

course, exceptions. Small-minded officials, rude waiters, and ill-mannered taxi drivers 

are hardly unknown in the US. Yet it is an observation made so frequently that it deserves 

comment.
For a long period of time and in many parts of the country, a traveler was a welcome break 

in an otherwise dull existence. Dullness and loneliness were common problems of the 

families who generally lived distant from one another. Strangers and travelers were 

welcome sources of diversion, and brought news of the outside world.
The harsh realities of the frontier also shaped this tradition of hospitality. Someone 

traveling alone, if hungry, injured, or ill, often had nowhere to turn except to the 

nearest cabin or settlement. It was not a matter of choice for the traveler or merely a 

charitable impulse on the part of the settlers. It reflected the harshness of daily life: 

if you didn¡¯t take in the stranger and take care of him, there was no one else who would. 

And someday, remember, you might be in the same situation.
Today there are many charitable organizations which specialize in helping the weary 

traveler. Yet, the old tradition of hospitality to strangers is still very strong in the 

US, especially in the smaller cities and towns away from the busy tourist trails. ¡°I was 

just traveling through, got talking with this American, and pretty soon he invited me home 

for dinner -- amazing.¡± Such observations reported by visitors to the US are not 

uncommon, but are not always understood properly. The casual friendliness of many 

Americans should be interpreted neither as superficial nor as artificial, but as the 

result of a historically developed cultural tradition.
As is true of any developed society, in America a complex set of cultural signals, 

assumptions, and conventions underlies all social interrelationships. And, of course, 

speaking a language does not necessarily mean that someone understands social and cultural 

patterns. Visitors who fail to ¡°translate¡± cultural meanings properly often draw wrong 

conclusions. For example, when an American uses the word ¡°friend,¡± the cultural 

implications of the word may be quite different from those it has in the visitor¡¯s 

language and culture. It takes more than a brief encounter on a bus to distinguish between 

courteous convention and individual interest. Yet, being friendly is a virtue that many 

Americans value highly and expect from both neighbors and strangers.
55.	In the eyes of visitors from the outside world, ________.
[A] rude taxi drivers are rarely seen in the US
[B] small-minded officials deserve a serious comment
[C] Canadians are not so friendly as their neighbors
[D] most Americans are ready to offer help
56.	It could be inferred from the last paragraph that ________.
[A] culture exercises an influence over social interrelationship
[B] courteous convention and individual interest are interrelated
[C] various virtues manifest themselves exclusively among friends
[D] social interrelationships equal the complex set of cultural conventions
57.	Families in frontier settlements used to entertain strangers ________.
[A] to improve their hard life
[B] in view of their long-distance travel

Technically, any substance other than food that alters our bodily or mental functioning is 

a drug. Many people mistakenly believe the term drug refers only to some sort of medicine 

or an illegal chemical taken by drug addicts. They don¡¯t realize that familiar substances 

such as alcohol and tobacco are also drugs. This is why the more neutral term substance is 

now used by many physicians and psychologists. The phrase ¡°substance abuse¡± is often 

used instead of ¡°drug abuse¡± to make clear that substances such as alcohol and tobacco 

can be just as harmfully misused as heroin and cocaine.
We live in a society in which the medicinal and social use of substances (drugs) is 

pervasive: an aspirin to quiet a headache, some wine to be sociable, coffee to get going 

in the morning, a cigarette for the nerves. When do these socially acceptable and 

apparently constructive uses of a substance become misuses? First of all, most substances 

taken in excess will produce negative effects such as poisoning or intense perceptual 

distortions. Repeated use of a substance can also lead to physical addiction or substance 

dependence. Dependence is marked first by an increased tolerance, with more and more of 

the substance required to produce the desired effect, and then by the appearance of 

unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when the substance is discontinued.
Drugs (substances) that affect the central nervous system and alter perception, mood, and 

behavior are known as psychoactive substances. Psychoactive substances are commonly 

grouped according to whether they are stimulants, depressants, or hallucinogens. 

Stimulants initially speed up or activate the central nervous system, whereas depressants 

slow it down. Hallucinogens have their primary effect on perception, distorting and 

altering it in a variety of ways including producing hallucinations. These are the 

substances often called psychedelic (from the Greek word meaning ¡°mind-manifesting¡±) 

because they seemed to radically alter one¡¯s state of consciousness.
59.	¡°Substance abuse¡± (Line 5, Paragraph 1) is preferable to ¡°drug abuse¡± in that 

________.
[A] substances can alter our bodily or mental functioning if illegally used
[B] ¡°drug abuse¡± is only related to a limited number of drug takers
[C] alcohol and tobacco are as fatal as heroin and cocaine
[D] many substances other than heroin or cocaine can also be poisonous
60.	The word ¡°pervasive¡± (Line 1, Paragraph 2) might mean ________.
[A] widespread
[B] overwhelming
[C] piercing
[D] fashionable
61.	Physical dependence on certain substances results from ________.
[A] uncontrolled consumption of them over long periods of time
[B] exclusive use of them for social purposes
[C] quantitative application of them to the treatment of diseases
[D] careless employment of them for unpleasant symptoms
62.	From the last paragraph we can infer that ________.
[A] stimulants function positively on the mind
[B] hallucinogens are in themselves harmful to health
[C] depressants are the worst type of psychoactive substances
[D] the three types of psychoactive substances are commonly used in groups

No company likes to be told it is contributing to the moral decline of a nation. ¡°Is this 

what you intended to accomplish with your careers?¡± Senator Robert Dole asked Time Warner 

executives last week. ¡°You have sold your souls, but must you corrupt our nation and 

threaten our children as well?¡± At Time Warner, however, such questions are simply the 

latest manifestation of the soul-searching that has involved the company ever since the 

company was born in 1990. It¡¯s a self-examination that has, at various times, involved 

issues of responsibility, creative freedom and the corporate bottom line.
At the core of this debate is chairman Gerald Levin, 56, who took over for the late Steve 

Ross in 1992. On the financial front, Levin is under pressure to raise the stock price and 

reduce the company¡¯s mountainous debt, which will increase to $17.3 billion after two new 

cable deals close. He has promised to sell off some of the property and restructure the 

company, but investors are waiting impatiently.
The flap over rap is not making life any easier for him. Levin has consistently defended 

the company¡¯s rap music on the grounds of expression. In 1992, when Time Warner was under 

fire for releasing Ice-T¡¯s violent rap song Cop Killer, Levin described rap as a lawful 

expression of street culture, which deserves an outlet. ¡°The test of any democratic 

society,¡± he wrote in a Wall Street Journal column, ¡°lies not in how well it can control 

expression but in whether it gives freedom of thought and expression the widest possible 

latitude, however disputable or irritating the results may sometimes be. We won¡¯t retreat 

in the face of any threats.¡±
Levin would not comment on the debate last week, but there were signs that the chairman 

was backing off his hard-line stand, at least to some extent. During the discussion of 

rock singing verses at last month¡¯s stockholders¡¯ meeting, Levin asserted that ¡°music 

is not the cause of society¡¯s ills¡± and even cited his son, a teacher in the Bronx, New 

York, who uses rap to communicate with students. But he talked as well about the 

¡°balanced struggle¡± between creative freedom and social responsibility, and he announced 

that the company would launch a drive to develop standards for distribution and labeling 

of potentially objectionable music.
The 15-member Time Warner board is generally supportive of Levin and his corporate 

strategy. But insiders say several of them have shown their concerns in this matter. 

¡°Some of us have known for many, many years that the freedoms under the First Amendment 

are not totally unlimited,¡± says Luce. ¡°I think it is perhaps the case that some people 

associated with the company have only recently come to realize this.¡±
63.	Senator Robert Dole criticized Time Warner for ________.
[A] its raising of the corporate stock price
[B] its self-examination of soul
[C] its neglect of social responsibility
[D] its emphasis on creative freedom
64.	According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?
[A] Luce is a spokesman of Time Warner.
[B] Gerald Levin is liable to compromise.
[C] Time Warner is united as one in the face of the debate.
[D] Steve Ross is no longer alive.
65.	In face of the recent attacks on the company, the chairman ________.

[B] softened his tone and adopted some new policy
[C] changed his attitude and yielded to objection
[D] received more support from the 15-member board
66.	The best title for this passage could be ________.
[A] A Company under Fire
[B] A Debate on Moral Decline
[C] A Lawful Outlet of Street Culture
[D] A Form of Creative Freedom

Much of the language used to describe monetary policy, such as ¡°steering the economy to a 

soft landing¡± or ¡°a touch on the brakes,¡± makes it sound like a precise science. 

Nothing could be further from the truth. The link between interest rates and inflation is 

uncertain. And there are long, variable lags before policy changes have any effect on the 

economy. Hence the analogy that likens the conduct of monetary policy to driving a car 

with a blackened windscreen, a cracked rear-view mirror and a faulty steering wheel.
Given all these disadvantages, central bankers seem to have had much to boast about of 

late. Average inflation in the big seven industrial economies fell to a mere 2.3% last 

year, close to its lowest level in 30 years, before rising slightly to 2.5% this July. 

This is a long way below the double-digit rates which many countries experienced in the 

1970s and early 1980s.
It is also less than most forecasters had predicted. In late 1994 the panel of economists 

which The Economist polls each month said that America¡¯s inflation rate would average 

3.5% in 1995. In fact, it fell to 2.6% in August, and is expected to average only about 3% 

for the year as a whole. In Britain and Japan inflation is running half a percentage point 

below the rate predicted at the end of last year. This is no flash in the pan; over the 

past couple of years, inflation has been consistently lower than expected in Britain and 

America.
Economists have been particularly surprised by favorable inflation figures in Britain and 

the United States, since conventional measures suggest that both economies, and especially 

America¡¯s, have little productive slack. America¡¯s capacity utilization, for example, 

hit historically high levels earlier this year, and its jobless rate (5.6% in August) has 

fallen below most estimates of the natural rate of unemployment -- the rate below which 

inflation has taken off in the past.
Why has inflation proved so mild? The most thrilling explanation is, unfortunately, a 

little defective. Some economists argue that powerful structural changes in the world have 

upended the old economic models that were based upon the historical link between growth 

and inflation.
67.	From the passage we learn that ________.
[A] there is a definite relationship between inflation and interest rates
[B] economy will always follow certain models
[C] the economic situation is better than expected
[D] economists had foreseen the present economic situation
68.	According to the passage, which of the following is TRUE?
[A] Making monetary policies is comparable to driving a car
[B] An extremely low jobless rate will lead to inflation
[C] A high unemployment rate will result from inflation
[D] Interest rates have an immediate effect on the economy
69.	The sentence ¡°This is no flash in the pan¡± (Line 5, Paragraph 3) means that 

________.
[A] the low inflation rate will last for some time
[B] the inflation rate will soon rise
[C] the inflation will disappear quickly
[D] there is no inflation at present
70.	The passage shows that the author is ________ the present situation.
[A] critical of
[B] puzzled by
[C] disappointed at
[D] amazed at
Section IV	English-Chinese Translation
Directions:
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into 

Chinese. Your translation must be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
Do animals have rights? This is how the question is usually put. It sounds like a useful, 

ground-clearing way to start. 71) Actually, it isn¡¯t, because it assumes that there is an 

agreed account of human rights, which is something the world does not have.
On one view of rights, to be sure, it necessarily follows that animals have none. 72) Some 

philosophers argue that rights exist only within a social contract, as part of an exchange 

of duties and entitlements. Therefore, animals cannot have rights. The idea of punishing a 

tiger that kills somebody is absurd, for exactly the same reason, so is the idea that 

tigers have rights. However, this is only one account, and by no means an uncontested one. 

It denies rights not only to animals but also to some people -- for instance, to infants, 

the mentally incapable and future generations. In addition, it is unclear what force a 

contract can have for people who never consented to it: how do you reply to somebody who 

says ¡°I don¡¯t like this contract¡±?
The point is this: without agreement on the rights of people, arguing about the rights of 

animals is fruitless. 73) It leads the discussion to extremes at the outset: it invites 

you to think that animals should be treated either with the consideration humans extend to 

other humans, or with no consideration at all. This is a false choice. Better to start 

with another, more fundamental, question: is the way we treat animals a moral issue at 

all?
Many deny it. 74) Arguing from the view that humans are different from animals in every 

relevant respect, extremists of this kind think that animals lie outside the area of moral 

choice. Any regard for the suffering of animals is seen as a mistake -- a sentimental 

displacement of feeling that should properly be directed to other humans.
This view, which holds that torturing a monkey is morally equivalent to chopping wood, may 

seem bravely ¡°logical.¡± In fact it is simply shallow: the confused center is right to 

reject it. The most elementary form of moral reasoning -- the ethical equivalent of 

learning to crawl -- is to weigh others¡¯ interests against one¡¯s own. This in turn 

requires sympathy and imagination: without which there is no capacity for moral thought. 

To see an animal in pain is enough, for most, to engage sympathy. 75) When that happens, 

it is not a mistake: it is mankind¡¯s instinct for moral reasoning in action, an instinct 

that should be encouraged rather than laughed at.

Section V	Writing
Directions:
[A] Study the following set of pictures carefully and write an essay in no less than 120 

words.
[B] Your essay must be written clearly on the ANSWER SHEET. (15 points)
[C] Your essay should cover all the information provided and meet the requirements below:
1. Interpret the following pictures.
2. Predict the tendency of tobacco consumption and give your reasons.

 

ÀýÎÄÒ»
We meet smokers everywhere: in the streets, on college campuses and in shops. There are 

5.8 billion people in the world, and the smokers are about 1.1 billion, which makes up 20 

percent of the world¡¯s total population.
Smoking is very harmful. I think there are two main aspects to the damage. First, smoking 

consumes a great deal of money. As is shown in the pictorial graph, smoking wastes 200 

billion dollars each year in the world. Second, smoking does harm to the health of 

smokers, and it is the main cause of lung cancer. About 3 million people die because of 

the relevant diseases derived from smoking every year.
Because more and more people are aware of the great harm of smoking to humans, the amount 

of tobacco consumption is on the decrease. From the following figures we can clearly see 

the tendency. The total amount of world tobacco production added up to 14.364 billion 

pounds in 1994, but it dropped to 14.2 billion pounds in 1995. At the same time, many 

countries call on people to give up smoking. So it is certain that the number of smokers 

is to decrease.
ÀýÎÄ¶þ
About Tobacco Consumption
From the above set of pictures, we can see that there were a total of 14.364 billion 

pounds of tobacco produced in 1994 and 14.2 billion pounds in 1995. Because the amount of 

tobacco production is falling yearly, it can be predicted that the tendency of tobacco 

consumption would also be falling yearly. There are many reasons. Firstly, smoking wastes 

money. Every year there are two hundred billion dollars ¡°burnt¡± in the cigarette ¡°fire.

¡± Secondly, smoking would hardly do people any good and it can even cause cancer. Every 

year there are three million people ¡°buried¡± in the cigarette ¡°tomb¡±.
Although tobacco consumption is falling, there are too many people who smoke. The 

population in the world is 5.8 billion, but about twenty percent of the population, that 

is to say 1.1 billion people, smoke. So the situation is serious and the movement against 

smoking is still a difficult task.

Until recently most historians spoke very critically of the Industrial Revolution. They  

41  that in the long run industrialization greatly raised the standard of living for the 

 42  man. But they insisted that its  43  results during the period from 1750 to 1850 

were widespread poverty and misery for the  44  of the English population.  45  

contrast, they saw in the preceding hundred years from 1650 to 1750, when England was 

still a  46  agricultural country, a period of great abundance and prosperity.
This view,  47 , is generally thought to be wrong. Specialists  48  history and 

economics, have  49  two things: that the period from 1650 to 1750 was  50  by great 

poverty, and that industrialization certainly did not worsen and may have actually

Text 1
Few creations of big technology capture the imagination like giant dams. Perhaps it is 

humankind¡¯s long suffering at the mercy of flood and drought that makes the idea of 

forcing the waters to do our bidding so fascinating. But to be fascinated is also, 

sometimes, to be blind. Several giant dam projects threaten to do more harm than good.
The lesson from dams is that big is not always beautiful. It doesn¡¯t help that building a 

big, powerful dam has become a symbol of achievement for nations and people striving to 

assert themselves. Egypt¡¯s leadership in the Arab world was cemented by the Aswan High 

Dam. Turkey¡¯s bid for First World status includes the giant Ataturk Dam.
But big dams tend not to work as intended. The Aswan Dam, for example, stopped the Nile 

flooding but deprived Egypt of the fertile silt that floods left -- all in return for a 

giant reservoir of disease which is now so full of silt that it barely generates 

electricity.
And yet, the myth of controlling the waters persists. This week, in the heart of civilized 

Europe, Slovaks and Hungarians stopped just short of sending in the troops in their 

contention over a dam on the Danube. The huge complex will probably have all the usual 

problems of big dams. But Slovakia is bidding for independence from the Czechs, and now 

needs a dam to prove itself.
Meanwhile, in India, the World Bank has given the go-ahead to the even more wrong-headed 

Narmada Dam. And the bank has done this even though its advisors say the dam will cause 

hardship for the powerless and environmental destruction. The benefits are for the 

powerful, but they are far from guaranteed.
Proper, scientific study of the impacts of dams and of the cost and benefits of 

controlling water can help to resolve these conflicts. Hydroelectric power and flood 

control and irrigation are possible without building monster dams. But when you are 

dealing with myths, it is hard to be either proper, or scientific. It is time that the 

world learned the lessons of Aswan. You don¡¯t need a dam to be saved.

Well, no gain without pain, they say. But what about pain without gain? Everywhere you go 

in America, you hear tales of corporate revival. What is harder to establish is whether 

the productivity revolution that businessmen assume they are presiding over is for real.
The official statistics are mildly discouraging. They show that, if you lump manufacturing 

and services together, productivity has grown on average by 1.2% since 1987. That is 

somewhat faster than the average during the previous decade. And since 1991, productivity 

has increased by about 2% a year, which is more than twice the 1978-87 average. The 

trouble is that part of the recent acceleration is due to the usual rebound that occurs at 

this point in a business cycle, and so is not conclusive evidence of a revival in the 

underlying trend. There is, as Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, says, a ¡°disjunction

¡± between the mass of business anecdote that points to a leap in productivity and the 

picture reflected by the statistics.
Some of this can be easily explained. New ways of organizing the workplace -- all that 

re-engineering and downsizing -- are only one contribution to the overall productivity of 

an economy, which is driven by many other factors such as joint investment in equipment 

and machinery, new technology, and investment in education and training. Moreover, most of 

the changes that companies make are intended to keep them profitable, and this need not 

always mean increasing productivity: switching to new markets or improving quality can 

matter just as much.
Two other explanations are more speculative. First, some of the business restructuring of 

recent years may have been ineptly done. Second, even if it was well done, it may have 

spread much less widely than people suppose.
Leonard Schlesinger, a Harvard academic and former chief executive of Au Bong Pain, a 

rapidly growing chain of bakery cafes, says that much ¡°re-engineering¡± has been crude. 

In many cases, he believes, the loss of revenue has been greater than the reductions in 

cost. His colleague, Michael Beer, says that far too many companies have applied re-

engineering in a mechanistic fashion, chopping out costs without giving sufficient thought 

to long-term profitability. BBDO¡¯s Al Rosenshine is blunter. He dismisses a lot of the 

work of re-engineering consultants as mere rubbish -- ¡°the worst sort of ambulance 

chasing.¡±
55.	According to the author, the American economic situation is ________.
[A] not as good as it seems
[B] at its turning point
[C] much better than it seems
[D] near to complete recovery
56.	The official statistics on productivity growth ________.
[A] exclude the usual rebound in a business cycle
[B] fall short of businessmen¡¯s anticipation
[C] meet the expectation of business people
[D] fail to reflect the true state of economy
57.	The author raises the question ¡°what about pain without gain?¡± because ________.
[A] he questions the truth of ¡°no gain without pain¡±
[B] he does not think the productivity revolution works
[C] he wonders if the official statistics are misleading
[D] he has conclusive evidence for the revival of businesses
58.	Which of the following statements is NOT mentioned in the passage?
[A] Radical reforms are essential for the increase of productivity.
[B] New ways of organizing workplaces may help to increase productivity.
[C] The reduction of costs is not a sure way to gain long-term profitability.
[D] The consultants are a bunch of good-for-nothings.

Science has long had an uneasy relationship with other aspects of culture. Think of 

Gallileo¡¯s 17th-century trial for his rebelling belief before the Catholic Church or poet 

William Blake¡¯s harsh remarks against the mechanistic worldview of Isaac Newton. The 

schism between science and the humanities has, if anything, deepened in this century.
Until recently, the scientific community was so powerful that it could afford to ignore 

its critics -- but no longer. As funding for science has declined, scientists have 

attacked ¡°anti-science¡± in several books, notably Higher Superstition, by Paul R. Gross, 

a biologist at the University of Virginia, and Norman Levitt, a mathematician at Rutgers 

University; and The Demon-Haunted World, by Carl Sagan of Cornell University.
Defenders of science have also voiced their concerns at meetings such as ¡°The Flight from 

Science and Reason,¡± held in New York City in 1995, and ¡°Science in the Age of (Mis) 

information,¡± which assembled last June near Buffalo.
Anti-science clearly means different things to different people. Gross and Levitt find 

fault primarily with sociologists, philosophers and other academics who have questioned 

science¡¯s objectivity. Sagan is more concerned with those who believe in ghosts, 

creationism and other phenomena that contradict the scientific worldview.
A survey of news stories in 1996 reveals that the anti-science tag has been attached to 

many other groups as well, from authorities who advocated the elimination of the last 

remaining stocks of smallpox virus to Republicans who advocated decreased funding for 

basic research.
Few would dispute that the term applies to the Unabomber, whose manifesto, published in 

1995, scorns science and longs for return to a pre-technological utopia. But surely that 

does not mean environmentalists concerned about uncontrolled industrial growth are anti-

science, as an essay in US News & World Report last May seemed to suggest.
The environmentalists, inevitably, respond to such critics. The true enemies of science, 

argues Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University, a pioneer of environmental studies, are those 

who question the evidence supporting global warming, the depletion of the ozone layer and 

other consequences of industrial growth.
Indeed, some observers fear that the anti-science epithet is in danger of becoming 

meaningless. ¡°The term ¡®anti-science¡¯ can lump together too many, quite different 

things,¡± notes Harvard University philosopher Gerald Holton in his 1993 work Science and 

Anti-Science. ¡°They have in common only one thing that they tend to annoy or threaten 

those who regard themselves as more enlightened.¡±
59.	The word ¡°schism¡± (Line 4, Paragraph 1) in the context probably means ________.
[A] confrontation
[B] dissatisfaction
[C] separation
[D] contempt
60.	Paragraphs 2 and 3 are written to ________.
[A] discuss the cause of the decline of science¡¯s power
[B] show the author¡¯s sympathy with scientists
[C] explain the way in which science develops
[D] exemplify the division of science and the humanities
61.	Which of the following is true according to the passage?
[A] Environmentalists were blamed for anti-science in an essay.
[B] Politicians are not subject to the labeling of anti-science.
[C] The ¡°more enlightened¡± tend to tag others as anti-science.
[D] Tagging environmentalists as ¡°anti-science¡± is justifiable.
62.	The author¡¯s attitude toward the issue of ¡°science vs. anti-science¡± is 

________.
[A] impartial
[B] subjective
[C] biased
[D] puzzling

Emerging from the 1980 census is the picture of a nation developing more and more regional 

competition, as population growth in the Northeast and Midwest reaches a near standstill.
This development -- and its strong implications for US politics and economy in years ahead 

-- has enthroned the South as America¡¯s most densely populated region for the first time 

in the history of the nation¡¯s head counting.
Altogether, the US population rose in the 1970s by 23.2 million people -- numerically the 

third-largest growth ever recorded in a single decade. Even so, that gain adds up to only 

11.4 percent, lowest in American annual records except for the Depression years.
Americans have been migrating south and west in larger numbers since World War II, and the 

pattern still prevails.
Three sun-belt states -- Florida, Texas and California -- together had nearly 10 million 

more people in 1980 than a decade earlier. Among large cities, San Diego moved from 14th 

to 8th and San Antonio from 15th to 10th -- with Cleveland and Washington. D. C., dropping 

out of the top 10.
Not all that shift can be attributed to the movement out of the snow belt, census 

officials say. Nonstop waves of immigrants played a role, too -- and so did bigger crops 

of babies as yesterday¡¯s ¡°baby boom¡± generation reached its child-bearing years.
Moreover, demographers see the continuing shift south and west as joined by a related but 

newer phenomenon: More and more, Americans apparently are looking not just for places with 

more jobs but with fewer people, too. Some instances¡ª
¡öRegionally, the Rocky Mountain states reported the most rapid growth rate -- 37.1 

percent since 1970 in a vast area with only 5 percent of the US population.
¡öAmong states, Nevada and Arizona grew fastest of all: 63.5 and 53.1 percent 

respectively. Except for Florida and Texas, the top 10 in rate of growth is composed of 

Western states with 7.5 million people -- about 9 per square mile.
The flight from overcrowdedness affects the migration from snow belt to more bearable 

climates.
Nowhere do 1980 census statistics dramatize more the American search for spacious living 

than in the Far West. There, California added 3.7 million to its population in the 1970s, 

more than any other state.
In that decade, however, large numbers also migrated from California, mostly to other 

parts of the West. Often they chose -- and still are choosing -- somewhat colder climates 

such as Oregon, Idaho and Alaska in order to escape smog, crime and other plagues of 

urbanization in the Golden State.
As a result, California¡¯s growth rate dropped during the 1970s, to 18.5 percent -- little 

more than two thirds the 1960s¡¯ growth figure and considerably below that of other 

Western states.
63.	Discerned from the perplexing picture of population growth the 1980 census 

provided, America in 1970s ________.
[A] enjoyed the lowest net growth of population in history
[B] witnessed a southwestern shift of population
[C] underwent an unparalleled period of population growth
[D] brought to a standstill its pattern of migration since World War II
64.	The census distinguished itself from previous studies on population movement in 

that ________.
[A] it stresses the climatic influence on population distribution
[B] it highlights the contribution of continuous waves of immigrants
[C] it reveals the Americans¡¯ new pursuit of spacious living
[D] it elaborates the delayed effects of yesterday¡¯s ¡°baby boom¡±
65.	We can see from the available statistics that ________.
[A] California was once the most thinly populated area in the whole US
[B] the top 10 states in growth rate of population were all located in the West
[C] cities with better climates benefited unanimously from migration
[D] Arizona ranked second of all states in its growth rate of population
66.	The word ¡°demographers¡± (Line 1, Paragraph 8) most probably means ________.
[A] people in favor of the trend of democracy
[B] advocates of migration between states
[C] scientists engaged in the study of population
[D] conservatives clinging to old patterns of life
Text 5
Scattered around the globe are more than 100 small regions of isolated volcanic activity 

known to geologists as hot spots. Unlike most of the world¡¯s volcanoes, they are not 

always found at the boundaries of the great drifting plates that make up the earth¡¯s 

surface; on the contrary, many of them lie deep in the interior of a plate. Most of the 

hot spots move only slowly, and in some cases the movement of the plates past them has 

left trails of dead volcanoes. The hot spots and their volcanic trails are milestones that 

mark the passage of the plates.
That the plates are moving is now beyond dispute. Africa and South America, for example, 

are moving away from each other as new material is injected into the sea floor between 

them. The complementary coastlines and certain geological features that seem to span the 

ocean are reminders of where the two continents were once joined. The relative motion of 

the plates carrying these continents has been constructed in detail, but the motion of one 

plate with respect to another cannot readily be translated into motion with respect to the 

earth¡¯s interior. It is not possible to determine whether both continents are moving in 

opposite directions or whether one continent is stationary and the other is drifting away 

from it. Hot spots, anchored in the deeper layers of the earth, provide the measuring 

instruments needed to resolve the question. From an analysis of the hot-spot population it 

appears that the African plate is stationary and that it has not moved during the past 30 

million years.
The significance of hot spots is not confined to their role as a frame of reference. It 

now appears that they also have an important influence on the geophysical processes that 

propel the plates across the globe. When a continental plate come to rest over a hot spot, 

the material rising from deeper layers creates a broad dome. As the dome grows, it 

develops deep fissures (cracks); in at least a few cases the continent may break entirely 

along some of these fissures, so that the hot spot initiates the formation of a new ocean. 

Thus just as earlier theories have explained the mobility of the continents, so hot spots 

may explain their mutability (inconstancy).
67.	The author believes that ________.
[A] the motion of the plates corresponds to that of the earth¡¯s interior
[B] the geological theory about drifting plates has been proved to be true
[C] the hot spots and the plates move slowly in opposite directions
[D] the movement of hot spots proves the continents are moving apart
68.	That Africa and South America were once joined can be deduced from the fact that 

________.
[A] the two continents are still moving in opposite directions
[B] they have been found to share certain geological features
[C] the African plate has been stable for 30 million years
[D] over 100 hot spots are scattered all around the globe
69.	The hot spot theory may prove useful in explaining ________.
[A] the structure of the African plates
[B] the revival of dead volcanoes
[C] the mobility of the continents
[D] the formation of new oceans
70.	The passage is mainly about ________.
[A] the features of volcanic activities
[B] the importance of the theory about drifting plates
[C] the significance of hot spots in geophysical studies
[D] the process of the formation of volcanoes

They were, by far, the largest and most distant objects that scientists had ever detected: 

a strip of enormous cosmic clouds some 15 billion light-years from earth. 71) But even 

more important, it was the farthest that scientists had been able to look into the past, 

for what they were seeing were the patterns and structures that existed 15 billion years 

ago. That was just about the moment that the universe was born. What the researchers found 

was at once both amazing and expected: the US National Aeronautics and Space 

Administration¡¯s Cosmic Background Explorer satellite -- Cobe -- had discovered landmark 

evidence that the universe did in fact begin with the primeval explosion that has become 

known as the Big Bang (the theory that the universe originated in an explosion from a 

single mass of energy).
72) The existence of the giant clouds was virtually required for the Big Bang, first put 

forward in the 1920s, to maintain its reign as the dominant explanation of the cosmos. 

According to the theory, the universe burst into being as a submicroscopic, unimaginably 

dense knot of pure energy that flew outward in all directions, emitting radiation as it 

went, condensing into particles and then into atoms of gas. Over billions of years, the 

gas was compressed by gravity into galaxies, stars, plants and eventually, even humans.
Cobe is designed to see just the biggest structures, but astronomers would like to see 

much smaller hot spots as well, the seeds of local objects like clusters and superclusters 

of galaxies. They shouldn¡¯t have long to wait. 73) Astrophysicists working with ground-

based detectors at the South Pole and balloon-borne instruments are closing in on such 

structures, and may report their findings soon.
74) If the small hot spots look as expected, that will be a triumph for yet another 

scientific idea, a refinement of the Big Bang called the inflationary universe theory. 

Inflation says that very early on, the universe expanded in size by more than a trillion 

trillion trillion trillionfold in much less than a second, propelled by a sort of 

antigravity. 75) Odd though it sounds, cosmic inflation is a scientifically plausible 

consequence of some respected ideas in elementary particle physics, and many 

astrophysicists have been convinced for the better part of a decade that it is true.

It¡¯s a rough world out there. Step outside and you could break a leg slipping on your 

doormat. Light up the stove and you could burn down the house. Luckily, if the doormat or 

stove failed to warn of coming disaster, a successful lawsuit might compensate you for 

your troubles. Or so the thinking has gone since the early 1980s, when juries began 

holding more companies liable for their customers¡¯ misfortunes.
Feeling threatened, companies responded by writing ever-longer warning labels, trying to 

anticipate every possible accident. Today, stepladders carry labels several inches long 

that warn, among other things, that you might -- surprise! -- fall off. The label on a 

child¡¯s Batman cape cautions that the toy ¡°does not enable user to fly.¡±
While warnings are often appropriate and necessary -- the dangers of drug interactions, 

for example -- and many are required by state or federal regulations, it isn¡¯t clear that 

they actually protect the manufacturers and sellers from liability if a customer is 

injured. About 50 percent of the companies lose when injured customers take them to court.
Now the tide appears to be turning. As personal injury claims continue as before, some 

courts are beginning to side with defendants, especially in cases where a warning label 

probably wouldn¡¯t have changed anything. In May, Julie Nimmons, president of Schutt 

Sports in Illinois, successfully fought a lawsuit involving a football player who was 

paralyzed in a game while wearing a Schutt helmet. ¡°We¡¯re really sorry he has become 

paralyzed, but helmets aren¡¯t designed to prevent those kinds of injuries,¡± says 

Nimmons. The jury agreed that the nature of the game, not the helmet, was the reason for 

the athlete¡¯s injury. At the same time, the American Law Institute -- a group of judges, 

lawyers, and academics whose recommendations carry substantial weight -- issued new 

guidelines for tort law stating that companies need not warn customers of obvious dangers 

or bombard them with a lengthy list of possible ones. ¡°Important information can get 

buried in a sea of trivialities,¡± says a law professor at Cornell law School who helped 

draft the new guidelines. If the moderate end of the legal community has its way, the 

information on products might actually be provided for the benefit of customers and not as 

protection against legal liability.
51.	What were things like in 1980s when accidents happened?
[A] Customers might be relieved of their disasters through lawsuits.
[B] Injured customers could expect protection from the legal system.
[C] Companies would avoid being sued by providing new warnings.
[D] Juries tended to find fault with the compensations companies promised.
52.	Manufacturers as mentioned in the passage tend to ________.
[A] satisfy customers by writing long warnings on products
[B] become honest in describing the inadequacies of their products
[C] make the best use of labels to avoid legal liability
[D] feel obliged to view customers¡¯ safety as their first concern
53.	The case of Schutt helmet demonstrated that ________.
[A] some injury claims were no longer supported by law
[B] helmets were not designed to prevent injuries
[C] product labels would eventually be discarded
[D] some sports games might lose popularity with athletes
54.	The author¡¯s attitude towards the issue seems to be ________.
[A] biased
[B] indifferent
[C] puzzling
[D] objective

In the first year or so of Web business, most of the action has revolved around efforts to 

tap the consumer market. More recently, as the Web proved to be more than a fashion, 

companies have started to buy and sell products and services with one another. Such 

business-to-business sales make sense because businesspeople typically know what product 

they¡¯re looking for.
Nonetheless, many companies still hesitate to use the Web because of doubts about its 

reliability. ¡°Businesses need to feel they can trust the pathway between them and the 

supplier,¡± says senior analyst Blane Erwin of Forrester Research. Some companies are 

limiting the risk by conducting online transactions only with established business 

partners who are given access to the company¡¯s private intranet.
Another major shift in the model for Internet commerce concerns the technology available 

for marketing. Until recently, Internet marketing activities have focused on strategies to 

¡°pull¡± customers into sites. In the past year, however, software companies have 

developed tools that allow companies to ¡°push¡± information directly out to consumers, 

transmitting marketing messages directly to targeted customers. Most notably, the 

Pointcast Network uses a screen saver to deliver a continually updated stream of news and 

advertisements to subscribers¡¯ computer monitors. Subscribers can customize the 

information they want to receive and proceed directly to a company¡¯s Web site. Companies 

such as Virtual Vineyards are already starting to use similar technologies to push 

messages to customers about special sales, product offerings, or other events. But push 

technology has earned the contempt of many Web users. Online culture thinks highly of the 

notion that the information flowing onto the screen comes there by specific request. Once 

commercial promotion begins to fill the screen uninvited, the distinction between the Web 

and television fades. That¡¯s a prospect that horrifies Net purists.
But it is hardly inevitable that companies on the Web will need to resort to push 

strategies to make money. The examples of Virtual Vineyards, Amazon.com, and other 

pioneers show that a Web site selling the right kind of products with the right mix of 

interactivity, hospitality, and security will attract online customers. And the cost of 

computing power continues to free fall, which is a good sign for any enterprise setting up 

shop in silicon. People looking back 5 or 10 years from now may well wonder why so few 

companies took the online plunge.
55.	We learn from the beginning of the passage that Web business ________.
[A] has been striving to expand its market
[B] intended to follow a fanciful fashion
[C] tried but in vain to control the market
[D] has been booming for one year or so
56.	Speaking of the online technology available for marketing, the author implies that 

________.
[A] the technology is popular with many Web users
[B] businesses have faith in the reliability of online transactions
[C] there is a radical change in strategy
[D] it is accessible limitedly to established partners
57.	In the view of Net purists, ________.
[A] there should be no marketing messages in online culture
[B] money making should be given priority to on the Web
[C] the Web should be able to function as the television set
[D] there should be no online commercial information without requests
58.	We learn from the last paragraph that ________.
[A] pushing information on the Web is essential to Internet commerce
[B] interactivity, hospitality and security are important to online customers
[C] leading companies began to take the online plunge decades ago
[D] setting up shops in silicon is independent of the cost of computing power

An invisible border divides those arguing for computers in the classroom on the behalf of 

students¡¯ career prospects and those arguing for computers in the classroom for broader 

reasons of radical educational reform. Very few writers on the subject have explored this 

distinction -- indeed, contradiction -- which goes to the heart of what is wrong with the 

campaign to put computers in the classroom.
An education that aims at getting a student a certain kind of job is a technical 

education, justified for reasons radically different from why education is universally 

required by law. It is not simply to raise everyone¡¯s job prospects that all children are 

legally required to attend school into their teens. Rather, we have a certain conception 

of the American citizen, a character who is incomplete if he cannot competently assess how 

his livelihood and happiness are affected by things outside of himself. But this was not 

always the case; before it was legally required for all children to attend school until a 

certain age, it was widely accepted that some were just not equipped by nature to pursue 

this kind of education. With optimism characteristic of all industrialized countries, we 

came to accept that everyone is fit to be educated. Computer-education advocates forsake 

this optimistic notion for a pessimism that betrays their otherwise cheery outlook. 

Banking on the confusion between educational and vocational reasons for bringing computers 

into schools, computered advocates often emphasize the job prospects of graduates over 

their educational achievement.
There are some good arguments for a technical education given the right kind of student. 

Many European schools introduce the concept of professional training early on in order to 

make sure children are properly equipped for the professions they want to join. It is, 

however, presumptuous to insist that there will only be so many jobs for so many 

scientists, so many businessmen, so many accountants. Besides, this is unlikely to produce 

the needed number of every kind of professional in a country as large as ours and where 

the economy is spread over so many states and involves so many international corporations.
But, for a small group of students, professional training might be the way to go since 

well-developed skills, all other factors being equal, can be the difference between having 

a job and not. Of course, the basics of using any computer these days are very simple. It 

does not take a lifelong acquaintance to pick up various software programs. If one wanted 

to become a computer engineer, that is, of course, an entirely different story. Basic 

computer skills take -- at the very longest -- a couple of months to learn. In any case, 

basic computer skills are only complementary to the host of real skills that are necessary 

to becoming any kind of professional. It should be observed, of course, that no school, 

vocational or not, is helped by a confusion over its purpose.
59.	The author thinks the present rush to put computers in the classroom is ________.
[A] far-reaching
[B] dubiously oriented
[C] self-contradictory
[D] radically reformatory
60.	The belief that education is indispensable to all children ________.
[A] is indicative of a pessimism in disguise
[B] came into being along with the arrival of computers
[C] is deeply rooted in the minds of computered advocates
[D] originated from the optimistic attitude of industrialized countries
61.	It could be inferred from the passage that in the author¡¯s country the European 

model of professional training is ________.
[A] dependent upon the starting age of candidates
[B] worth trying in various social sections
[C] of little practical value
[D] attractive to every kind of professional
62.	According to the author, basic computer skills should be ________.
[A] included as an auxiliary course in school
[B] highlighted in acquisition of professional qualifications
[C] mastered through a life-long course
[D] equally emphasized by any school, vocational or otherwise

When a Scottish research team startled the world by revealing 3 months ago that it had 

cloned an adult sheep, President Clinton moved swiftly. Declaring that he was opposed to 

using this unusual animal husbandry technique to clone humans, he ordered that federal 

funds not be used for such an experiment -- although no one had proposed to do so -- and 

asked an independent panel of experts chaired by Princeton President Harold Shapiro to 

report back to the White House in 90 days with recommendations for a national policy on 

human cloning. That group -- the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) -- has been 

working feverishly to put its wisdom on paper, and at a meeting on 17 May, members agreed 

on a near-final draft of their recommendations.
NBAC will ask that Clinton¡¯s 90-day ban on federal funds for human cloning be extended 

indefinitely, and possibly that it be made law. But NBAC members are planning to word the 

recommendation narrowly to avoid new restrictions on research that involves the cloning of 

human DNA or cells -- routine in molecular biology. The panel has not yet reached 

agreement on a crucial question, however, whether to recommend legislation that would make 

it a crime for private funding to be used for human cloning.
In a draft preface to the recommendations, discussed at the 17 May meeting, Shapiro 

suggested that the panel had found a broad consensus that it would be ¡°morally 

unacceptable to attempt to create a human child by adult nuclear cloning.¡± Shapiro 

explained during the meeting that the moral doubt stems mainly from fears about the risk 

to the health of the child. The panel then informally accepted several general 

conclusions, although some details have not been settled.
NBAC plans to call for a continued ban on federal government funding for any attempt to 

clone body cell nuclei to create a child. Because current federal law already forbids the 

use of federal funds to create embryos (the earliest stage of human offspring before 

birth) for research or to knowingly endanger an embryo¡¯s life, NBAC will remain silent on 

embryo research.
NBAC members also indicated that they will appeal to privately funded researchers and 

clinics not to try to clone humans by body cell nuclear transfer. But they were divided on 

whether to go further by calling for a federal law that would impose a complete ban on 

human cloning. Shapiro and most members favored an appeal for such legislation, but in a 

phone interview, he said this issue was still ¡°up in the air.¡±
63.	We can learn from the first paragraph that ________.
[A] federal funds have been used in a project to clone humans
[B] the White House responded strongly to the news of cloning
[C] NBAC was authorized to control the misuse of cloning technique
[D] the White House has got the panel¡¯s recommendations on cloning
64.	The panel agreed on all of the following except that ________.
[A] the ban on federal funds for human cloning should be made a law
[B] the cloning of human DNA is not to be put under more control
[C] it is criminal to use private funding for human cloning
[D] it would be against ethical values to clone a human being
65.	NBAC will leave the issue of embryo research undiscussed because ________.
[A] embryo research is just a current development of cloning
[B] the health of the child is not the main concern of embryo research
[C] an embryo¡¯s life will not be endangered in embryo research
[D] the issue is explicitly stated and settled in the law
66.	It can be inferred from the last paragraph that ________.
[A] some NBAC members hesitate to ban human cloning completely
[B] a law banning human cloning is to be passed in no time
[C] privately funded researchers will respond positively to NBAC¡¯s appeal
[D] the issue of human cloning will soon be settled

Science, in practice, depends far less on the experiments it prepares than on the 

preparedness of the minds of the men who watch the experiments. Sir Isaac Newton 

supposedly discovered gravity through the fall of an apple. Apples had been falling in 

many places for centuries and thousands of people had seen them fall. But Newton for years 

had been curious about the cause of the orbital motion of the moon and planets. What kept 

them in place? Why didn¡¯t they fall out of the sky? The fact that the apple fell down 

toward the earth and not up into the tree answered the question he had been asking himself 

about those larger fruits of the heavens, the moon and the planets.
How many men would have considered the possibility of an apple falling up into the tree? 

Newton did because he was not trying to predict anything. He was just wondering. His mind 

was ready for the unpredictable. Unpredictability is part of the essential nature of 

research. If you don¡¯t have unpredictable things, you don¡¯t have research. Scientists 

tend to forget this when writing their cut and dried reports for the technical journals, 

but history is filled with examples of it.
In talking to some scientists, particularly younger ones, you might gather the impression 

that they find the ¡°scientific method¡± a substitute for imaginative thought. I¡¯ve 

attended research conferences where a scientist has been asked what he thinks about the 

advisability of continuing a certain experiment. The scientist has frowned, looked at the 

graphs, and said ¡°the data are still inconclusive.¡± ¡°We know that,¡± the men from the 

budget office have said, ¡°but what do you think? Is it worthwhile going on? What do you 

think we might expect?¡± The scientist has been shocked at having even been asked to 

speculate.
What this amounts to, of course, is that the scientist has become the victim of his own 

writings. He has put forward unquestioned claims so consistently that he not only believes 

them himself, but has convinced industrial and business management that they are true. If 

experiments are planned and carried out according to plan as faithfully as the reports in 

the science journals indicate, then it is perfectly logical for management to expect 

research to produce results measurable in dollars and cents. It is entirely reasonable for 

auditors to believe that scientists who know exactly where they are going and how they 

will get there should not be distracted by the necessity of keeping one eye on the cash 

register while the other eye is on the microscope. Nor, if regularity and conformity to a 

standard pattern are as desirable to the scientist as the writing of his papers would 

appear to reflect, is management to be blamed for discriminating against the ¡°odd balls¡± 

among researchers in favor of more conventional thinkers who ¡°work well with the team.¡±
67.	The author wants to prove with the example of Isaac Newton that ________.
[A] inquiring minds are more important than scientific experiments
[B] science advances when fruitful researches are conducted
[C] scientists seldom forget the essential nature of research
[D] unpredictability weighs less than prediction in scientific research
68.	The author asserts that scientists ________.
[A] shouldn¡¯t replace ¡°scientific method¡± with imaginative thought
[B] shouldn¡¯t neglect to speculate on unpredictable things
[C] should write more concise reports for technical journals
[D] should be confident about their research findings
69.	It seems that some young scientists ________.
[A] have a keen interest in prediction
[B] often speculate on the future
[C] think highly of creative thinking
[D] stick to ¡°scientific method¡±
70.	The author implies that the results of scientific research ________.
[A] may not be as profitable as they are expected
[B] can be measured in dollars and cents
[C] rely on conformity to a standard pattern
[D] are mostly underestimated by management
Section IV	English-Chinese Translation
Directions:
Read the following passage carefully and then translate underlined sentences into Chinese. 

Your translation must be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
71) While there are almost as many definitions of history as there are historians, modern 

practice most closely conforms to one that sees history as the attempt to recreate and 

explain the significant events of the past. Caught in the web of its own time and place, 

each generation of historians determines anew what is significant for it in the past. In 

this search the evidence found is always incomplete and scattered; it is also frequently 

partial or partisan. The irony of the historian¡¯s craft is that its practitioners always 

know that their efforts are but contributions to an unending process.
72) Interest in historical methods has arisen less through external challenge to the 

validity of history as an intellectual discipline and more from internal quarrels among 

historians themselves. While history once revered its affinity to literature and 

philosophy, the emerging social sciences seemed to afford greater opportunities for asking 

new questions and providing rewarding approaches to an understanding of the past. Social 

science methodologies had to be adapted to a discipline governed by the primacy of 

historical sources rather than the imperatives of the contemporary world. 73) During this 

transfer, traditional historical methods were augmented by additional methodologies 

designed to interpret the new forms of evidence in the historical study.
Methodology is a term that remains inherently ambiguous in the historical profession. 74) 

There is no agreement whether methodology refers to the concepts peculiar to historical 

work in general or to the research techniques appropriate to the various branches of 

historical inquiry. Historians, especially those so blinded by their research interests 

that they have been accused of ¡°tunnel method,¡± frequently fall victim to the 

¡°technicist fallacy.¡± Also common in the natural sciences, the technicist fallacy 

mistakenly identifies the discipline as a whole with certain parts of its technical 

implementation.
75) It applies equally to traditional historians who view history as only the external and 

internal criticism of sources, and to social science historians who equate their activity 

with specific techniques.
Section V	Writing
76.	Directions:
[A] Study the following graphs carefully and write an essay in at least 150 words.
[B] Your essay must be written neatly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
[C] Your essay should cover these three points:
1. effect of the country¡¯s growing human population on its wildlife
2. possible reason for the effect
3. your suggestion for wildlife protection
THE UPS AND DOWNS OF POPULATION GROWTH
 
 


The two graphs tell us something about population growth and wildlife extinction in the 

U.S. From 1800, the American population has been growing all the time. In the 100 years 

from 1600 to 1700, the number of wildlife species remained almost stable, with the next 

200 years witnessing a growing trend in wildlife extinction. It can be easily seen that 

the more the human beings, the fewer the animal species.
There may be several reasons for this effect. First, as human population expands, more and 

more wild animals are hunted for food. Second, due to all kinds of pollution and the 

damage of ecosystem caused by man, some animals have nowhere to live. Third, some animals 

are of great medical value, they become the targets for making money.
It is time we took some measures to stop this disturbing trend. On one hand, government 

should pass some laws and regulations to prevent people from killing more wild animals and 

forbid further damage to our environment. On the other hand, we should cultivate the 

awareness that animals are our friends and their extinction poses a threat rather than 

brings benefits to us. Only when human beings live in harmony with all kinds of animals 

can we really build a beautiful and healthy world.

A history of long and effortless success can be a dreadful handicap, but, if properly 

handled, it may become a driving force. When the United States entered just such a glowing 

period after the end of the Second World War, it had a market eight times larger than any 

competitor, giving its industries unparalleled economies of scale. Its scientists were the 

world¡¯s best, its workers the most skilled. America and Americans were prosperous beyond 

the dreams of the Europeans and Asians whose economies the war had destroyed.
It was inevitable that this primacy should have narrowed as other countries grew richer. 

Just as inevitably, the retreat from predominance proved painful. By the mid-1980s 

Americans had found themselves at a loss over their fading industrial competitiveness. 

Some huge American industries, such as consumer electronics, had shrunk or vanished in the 

face of foreign competition. By 1987 there was only one American television maker left, 

Zenith. (Now there is none: Zenith was bought by South Korea¡¯s LG Electronics in July.) 

Foreign-made cars and textiles were sweeping into the domestic market. America¡¯s 

machine-tool industry was on the ropes. For a while it looked as though the making of 

semiconductors, which America had invented and which sat at the heart of the new computer 

age, was going to be the next casualty.
All of this caused a crisis of confidence. Americans stopped taking prosperity for 

granted. They began to believe that their way of doing business was failing, and that 

their incomes would therefore shortly begin to fall as well. The mid-1980s brought one 

inquiry after another into the causes of America¡¯s industrial decline. Their sometimes 

sensational findings were filled with warnings about the growing competition from 

overseas.
How things have changed! In 1995 the United States can look back on five years of solid 

growth while Japan has been struggling. Few Americans attribute this solely to such 

obvious causes as a devalued dollar or the turning of the business cycle. Self-doubt has 

yielded to blind pride. ¡°American industry has changed its structure, has gone on a diet, 

has learnt to be more quick-witted,¡± according to Richard Cavanagh, executive dean of 

Harvard¡¯s Kennedy School of Government. ¡°It makes me proud to be an American just to see 

how our businesses are improving their productivity,¡± says Stephen Moore of the Cato 

Institute, a think-tank in Washington, DC. And William Sahlman of the Harvard Business 

School believes that people will look back on this period as ¡°a golden age of business 

management in the United States.¡±
51.	The U.S. achieved its predominance after World War II because ________.
[A] it had made painstaking efforts towards this goal
[B] its domestic market was eight times larger than before
[C] the war had destroyed the economies of most potential competitors
[D] the unparalleled size of its workforce had given an impetus to its economy
52.	The loss of U.S. predominance in the world economy in the 1980s is manifested in 

the fact that the American ________.
[A] TV industry had withdrawn to its domestic market
[B] semiconductor industry had been taken over by foreign enterprises
[C] machine-tool industry had collapsed after suicidal actions
[D] auto industry had lost part of its domestic market
53.	What can be inferred from the passage?

[B] Intense competition may contribute to economic progress.
[C] The revival of the economy depends on international cooperation.
[D] A long history of success may pave the way for further development.

[D] success in education

Being a man has always been dangerous. There are about 105 males born for every 100 

females, but this ratio drops to near balance at the age of maturity, and among 70-year-

olds there are twice as many women as men. But the great universal of male mortality is 

being changed. Now, boy babies survive almost as well as girls do. This means that, for 

the first time, there will be an excess of boys in those crucial years when they are 

searching for a mate. More important, another chance for natural selection has been 

removed. Fifty years ago, the chance of a baby (particularly a boy baby) surviving 

depended on its weight. A kilogram too light or too heavy meant almost certain death. 

Today it makes almost no difference. Since much of the variation is due to genes, one more 

agent of evolution has gone.
There is another way to commit evolutionary suicide: stay alive, but have fewer children. 

Few people are as fertile as in the past. Except in some religious communities, very few 

women have 15 children. Nowadays the number of births, like the age of death, has become 

average. Most of us have roughly the same number of offspring. Again, differences between 

people and the opportunity for natural selection to take advantage of it have diminished. 

India shows what is happening. The country offers wealth for a few in the great cities and 

poverty for the remaining tribal peoples. The grand mediocrity of today -- everyone being 

the same in survival and number of offspring -- means that natural selection has lost 80% 

of its power in upper-middle-class India compared to the tribes.
For us, this means that evolution is over; the biological Utopia has arrived. Strangely, 

it has involved little physical change. No other species fills so many places in nature. 

But in the pass 100,000 years -- even the pass 100 years -- our lives have been 

transformed but our bodies have not. We did not evolve, because machines and society did 

it for us. Darwin had a phrase to describe those ignorant of evolution: they ¡°look at an 

organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as at something wholly beyond his 

comprehension.¡± No doubt we will remember a 20th century way of life beyond comprehension 

for its ugliness. But however amazed our descendants may be at how far from Utopia we 

were, they will look just like us.
55.	What used to be the danger in being a man according to the first paragraph?
[A] A lack of mates.
[B] A fierce competition.
[C] A lower survival rate.
[D] A defective gene.
56.	What does the example of India illustrate?
[A] Wealthy people tend to have fewer children than poor people.
[B] Natural selection hardly works among the rich and the poor.
[C] The middle class population is 80% smaller than that of the tribes.
[D] India is one of the countries with a very high birth rate.
57.	The author argues that our bodies have stopped evolving because ________.
[A] life has been improved by technological advance
[B] the number of female babies has been declining
[C] our species has reached the highest stage of evolution
[D] the difference between wealth and poverty is disappearing
58.	Which of the following would be the best title for the passage?
[A] Sex Ratio Changes in Human Evolution
[B] Ways of Continuing Man¡¯s Evolution
[C] The Evolutionary Future of Nature
[D] Human Evolution Going Nowhere

When a new movement in art attains a certain fashion, it is advisable to find out what its 

advocates are aiming at, for, however farfetched and unreasonable their principles may 

seem today, it is possible that in years to come they may be regarded as normal. With 

regard to Futurist poetry, however, the case is rather difficult, for whatever Futurist 

poetry may be -- even admitting that the theory on which it is based may be right -- it 

can hardly be classed as Literature.
This, in brief, is what the Futurist says; for a century, past conditions of life have 

been conditionally speeding up, till now we live in a world of noise and violence and 

speed. Consequently, our feelings, thoughts and emotions have undergone a corresponding 

change. This speeding up of life, says the Futurist, requires a new form of expression. We 

must speed up our literature too, if we want to interpret modern stress. We must pour out 

a large stream of essential words, unhampered by stops, or qualifying adjectives, or 

finite verbs. Instead of describing sounds we must make up words that imitate them; we 

must use many sizes of type and different colored inks on the same page, and shorten or 

lengthen words at will.
Certainly their descriptions of battles are confused. But it is a little upsetting to read 

in the explanatory notes that a certain line describes a fight between a Turkish and a 

Bulgarian officer on a bridge off which they both fall into the river -- and then to find 

that the line consists of the noise of their falling and the weights of the officers: 

¡°Pluff! Pluff! A hundred and eighty-five kilograms.¡±
This, though it fulfills the laws and requirements of Futurist poetry, can hardly be 

classed as Literature. All the same, no thinking man can refuse to accept their first 

proposition: that a great change in our emotional life calls for a change of expression. 

The whole question is really this: have we essentially changed?
59.	This passage is mainly ________.
[A] a survey of new approaches to art
[B] a review of Futurist poetry
[C] about merits of the Futurist movement
[D] about laws and requirements of literature
60.	When a novel literary idea appears, people should try to ________.
[A] determine its purposes
[B] ignore its flaws
[C] follow the new fashions
[D] accept the principles
61.	Futurists claim that we must ________.
[A] increase the production of literature
[B] use poetry to relieve modern stress
[C] develop new modes of expression
[D] avoid using adjectives and verbs
62.	The author believes that Futurist poetry is ________.
[A] based on reasonable principles
[B] new and acceptable to ordinary people
[C] indicative of basic change in human nature
[D] more of a transient phenomenon than literature
Text 4
Aimlessness has hardly been typical of the postwar Japan whose productivity and social 

harmony are the envy of the United States and Europe. But increasingly the Japanese are 

seeing a decline of the traditional work-moral values. Ten years ago young people were 

hardworking and saw their jobs as their primary reason for being, but now Japan has 

largely fulfilled its economic needs, and young people don¡¯t know where they should go 

next.
The coming of age of the postwar baby boom and an entry of women into the male-dominated 

job market have limited the opportunities of teenagers who are already questioning the 

heavy personal sacrifices involved in climbing Japan¡¯s rigid social ladder to good 

schools and jobs. In a recent survey, it was found that only 24.5 percent of Japanese 

students were fully satisfied with school life, compared with 67.2 percent of students in 

the United States. In addition, far more Japanese workers expressed dissatisfaction with 

their jobs than did their counterparts in the 10 other countries surveyed.
While often praised by foreigners for its emphasis on the basics, Japanese education tends 

to stress test taking and mechanical learning over creativity and self-expression. ¡°Those 

things that do not show up in the test scores -- personality, ability, courage or humanity 

-- are completely ignored,¡± says Toshiki Kaifu, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic 

Party¡¯s education committee. ¡°Frustration against this kind of thing leads kids to drop 

out and run wild.¡± Last year Japan experienced 2,125 incidents of school violence, 

including 929 assaults on teachers. Amid the outcry, many conservative leaders are seeking 

a return to the prewar emphasis on moral education. Last year Mitsuo Setoyama, who was 

then education minister, raised eyebrows when he argued that liberal reforms introduced by 

the American occupation authorities after World War II had weakened the ¡°Japanese 

morality of respect for parents.¡±
But that may have more to do with Japanese life-styles. ¡°In Japan,¡± says educator Yoko 

Muro, ¡°it¡¯s never a question of whether you enjoy your job and your life, but only how 

much you can endure.¡± With economic growth has come centralization; fully 76 percent of 

Japan¡¯s 119 million citizens live in cities where community and the extended family have 

been abandoned in favor of isolated, two-generation households. Urban Japanese have long 

endured lengthy commutes (travels to and from work) and crowded living conditions, but as 

the old group and family values weaken, the discomfort is beginning to tell. In the past 

decade, the Japanese divorce rate, while still well below that of the United States, has 

increased by more than 50 percent, and suicides have increased by nearly one-quarter.
63.	In the Westerner¡¯s eyes, the postwar Japan was ________.
[A] under aimless development
[B] a positive example
[C] a rival to the West
[D] on the decline
64.	According to the author, what may chiefly be responsible for the moral decline of 

Japanese society?
[A] Women¡¯s participation in social activities is limited.
[B] More workers are dissatisfied with their jobs.
[C] Excessive emphasis has been placed on the basics.
[D] The life-style has been influenced by Western values.
65.	Which of the following is true according to the author?
[A] Japanese education is praised for helping the young climb the social ladder.
[B] Japanese education is characterized by mechanical learning as well as creativity.
[C] More stress should be placed on the cultivation of creativity.
[D] Dropping out leads to frustration against test taking.
66.	The change in Japanese life-style is revealed in the fact that ________.
[A] the young are less tolerant of discomforts in life
[B] the divorce rate in Japan exceeds that in the U.S.
[C] the Japanese endure more than ever before
[D] the Japanese appreciate their present life
Text 5
If ambition is to be well regarded, the rewards of ambition -- wealth, distinction, 

control over one¡¯s destiny -- must be deemed worthy of the sacrifices made on ambition¡¯s 

behalf. If the tradition of ambition is to have vitality, it must be widely shared; and it 

especially must be highly regarded by people who are themselves admired, the educated not 

least among them. In an odd way, however, it is the educated who have claimed to have 

given up on ambition as an ideal. What is odd is that they have perhaps most benefited 

from ambition -- if not always their own then that of their parents and grandparents. 

There is heavy note of hypocrisy in this, a case of closing the barn door after the horses 

have escaped -- with the educated themselves riding on them.
Certainly people do not seem less interested in success and its signs now than formerly. 

Summer homes, European travel, BMWs -- the locations, place names and name brands may 

change, but such items do not seem less in demand today than a decade or two years ago. 

What has happened is that people cannot confess fully to their dreams, as easily and 

openly as once they could, lest they be thought pushing, acquisitive and vulgar. Instead, 

we are treated to fine hypocritical spectacles, which now more than ever seem in ample 

supply: the critic of American materialism with a Southampton summer home; the publisher 

of radical books who takes his meals in three-star restaurants; the journalist advocating 

participatory democracy in all phases of life, whose own children are enrolled in private 

schools. For such people and many more perhaps not so exceptional, the proper formulation 

is, ¡°Succeed at all costs but avoid appearing ambitious.¡±
The attacks on ambition are many and come from various angles; its public defenders are 

few and unimpressive, where they are not extremely unattractive. As a result, the support 

for ambition as a healthy impulse, a quality to be admired and fixed in the mind of the 

young, is probably lower than it has ever been in the United States. This does not mean 

that ambition is at an end, that people no longer feel its stirrings and promptings, but 

only that, no longer openly honored, it is less openly professed. Consequences follow from 

this, of course, some of which are that ambition is driven underground, or made sly. Such, 

then, is the way things stand: on the left angry critics, on the right stupid supporters, 

and in the middle, as usual, the majority of earnest people trying to get on in life.
67.	It is generally believed that ambition may be well regarded if ________.
[A] its returns well compensate for the sacrifices
[B] it is rewarded with money, fame and power
[C] its goals are spiritual rather than material
[D] it is shared by the rich and the famous
68.	The last sentence of the first paragraph most probably implies that it is 

________.
[A] customary of the educated to discard ambition in words
[B] too late to check ambition once it has been let out
[C] dishonest to deny ambition after the fulfillment of the goal
[D] impractical for the educated to enjoy benefits from ambition
69.	Some people do not openly admit they have ambition because ________.
[A] they think of it as immoral
[B] their pursuits are not fame or wealth
[C] ambition is not closely related to material benefits
[D] they do not want to appear greedy and contemptible
70.	From the last paragraph the conclusion can be drawn that ambition should be 

maintained ________.
[A] secretly and vigorously
[B] openly and enthusiastically
[C] easily and momentarily
[D] verbally and spiritually

Chinese. Your translation must be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
Governments throughout the world act on the assumption that the welfare of their people 

depends largely on the economic strength and wealth of the community. 71) Under modern 

conditions, this requires varying measures of centralized control and hence the help of 

specialized scientists such as economists and operational research experts. 72) 

Furthermore, it is obvious that the strength of a country¡¯s economy is directly bound up 

with the efficiency of its agriculture and industry, and that this in turn rests upon the 

efforts of scientists and technologists of all kinds. It also means that governments are 

increasingly compelled to interfere in these sectors in order to step up production and 

ensure that it is utilized to the best advantage. For example, they may encourage research 

in various ways, including the setting up of their own research centers; they may alter 

the structure of education, or interfere in order to reduce the wastage of natural 

resources or tap resources hitherto unexploited; or they may cooperate directly in the 

growing number of international projects related to science, economics and industry. In 

any case, all such interventions are heavily dependent on scientific advice and also 

scientific and technological manpower of all kinds.
73) Owing to the remarkable development in mass-communications, people everywhere are 

feeling new wants and are being exposed to new customs and ideas, while governments are 

often forced to introduce still further innovations for the reasons given above. At the 

same time, the normal rate of social change throughout the world is taking place at a 

vastly accelerated speed compared with the past. For example, 74) in the early 

industrialized countries of Europe the process of industrialization -- with all the far-

reaching changes in social patterns that followed -- was spread over nearly a century, 

whereas nowadays a developing nation may undergo the same process in a decade or so. All 

this has the effect of building up unusual pressures and tensions within the community and 

consequently presents serious problems for the governments concerned. 75) Additional 

social stresses may also occur because of the population explosion or problems arising 

from mass migration movements -- themselves made relatively easy nowadays by modern means 

of transport. As a result of all these factors, governments are becoming increasingly 

dependent on biologists and social scientists for planning the appropriate programs and 

putting them into effect.

These two pictures display a sharp contrast: there were a lot of fish with one fishing 

boat in the sea in 1900 while the situation was just the opposite in 1995. Obviously, the 

fishing industry was facing a major problem, with all the ocean resources being exhausted 

so quickly.
The drawer is not exaggerating or joking about commercial fishing. On the contrary, he is 

seriously warning us that our way of thinking and ways of doing things are unreasonable 

and dangerous. Our resources are limited and our ecosystem needs careful consideration and 

protection. If we only care about the present, we will suffer in the future. It¡¯s just 

like building friendship and saving money: the more you put into it, the more you can get; 

the more you take out, the less it is left.
Measures should be taken if such disappointing situation is to be avoided. I suggest that 

government make laws and regulations to guide and supervise people¡¯s fishing activity, 

punishing those who only care about their own interest and bring harm to others and the 

environment. I also appeal to the public that money is not the only thing we can pursue 

and fish is not the only food we can eat. Whether for the benefit of the human race or for 

the interest of our own, we should show concern for others and make plans for the future. 

Only in this way can we live happily and affluently.

Text 1
Specialization can be seen as a response to the problem of an increasing accumulation of 

scientific knowledge. By splitting up the subject matter into smaller units, one man could 

continue to handle the information and use it as the basis for further research. But 

specialization was only one of a series of related developments in science affecting the 

process of communication. Another was the growing professionalisation of scientific 

activity.
No clear-cut distinction can be drawn between professionals and amateurs in science: 

exceptions can be found to any rule. Nevertheless, the word ¡°amateur¡± does carry a 

connotation that the person concerned is not fully integrated into the scientific 

community and, in particular, may not fully share its values. The growth of specialization 

in the nineteenth century, with its consequent requirement of a longer, more complex 

training, implied greater problems for amateur participation in science. The trend was 

naturally most obvious in those areas of science based especially on a mathematical or 

laboratory training, and can be illustrated in terms of the development of geology in the 

United Kingdom.
A comparison of British geological publications over the last century and a half reveals 

not simply an increasing emphasis on the primacy of research, but also a changing 

definition of what constitutes an acceptable research paper. Thus, in the nineteenth 

century, local geological studies represented worthwhile research in their own right; but, 

in the twentieth century, local studies have increasingly become acceptable to 

professionals only if they incorporate, and reflect on, the wider geological picture. 

Amateurs, on the other hand, have continued to pursue local studies in the old way. The 

overall result has been to make entrance to professional geological journals harder for 

amateurs, a result that has been reinforced by the widespread introduction of refereeing, 

first by national journals in the nineteenth century and then by several local geological 

journals in the twentieth century. As a logical consequence of this development, separate 

journals have now appeared aimed mainly towards either professional or amateur readership. 

A rather similar process of differentiation has led to professional geologists coming 

together nationally within one or two specific societies, whereas the amateurs have tended 

either to remain in local societies or to come together nationally in a different way.
Although the process of professionalisation and specialization was already well under way 

in British geology during the nineteenth century, its full consequences were thus delayed 

until the twentieth century. In science generally, however, the nineteenth century must be 

reckoned as the crucial period for this change in the structure of science.
51.	The growth of specialization in the 19th century might be more clearly seen in 

sciences such as ________.
[A] sociology and chemistry
[B] physics and psychology
[C] sociology and psychology
[D] physics and chemistry
52.	We can infer from the passage that ________.
[A] there is little distinction between specialization and professionalisation
[B] amateurs can compete with professionals in some areas of science
[C] professionals tend to welcome amateurs into the scientific community
[D] amateurs have national academic societies but no local ones
53.	The author writes of the development of geology to demonstrate ________.
[A] the process of specialization and professionalisation
[B] the hardship of amateurs in scientific study
[C] the change of policies in scientific publications
[D] the discrimination of professionals against amateurs
54.	The direct reason for specialization is ________.
[A] the development in communication
[B] the growth of professionalisation
[C] the expansion of scientific knowledge
[D] the splitting up of academic societies

A great deal of attention is being paid today to the so-called digital divide -- the 

division of the world into the info (information) rich and the info poor. And that divide 

does exist today. My wife and I lectured about this looming danger twenty years ago. What 

was less visible then, however, were the new, positive forces that work against the 

digital divide. There are reasons to be optimistic.
There are technological reasons to hope the digital divide will narrow. As the Internet 

becomes more and more commercialized, it is in the interest of business to universalize 

access -- after all, the more people online, the more potential customers there are. More 

and more governments, afraid their countries will be left behind, want to spread Internet 

access. Within the next decade or two, one to two billion people on the planet will be 

netted together. As a result, I now believe the digital divide will narrow rather than 

widen in the years ahead. And that is very good news because the Internet may well be the 

most powerful tool for combating world poverty that we¡¯ve ever had.
Of course, the use of the Internet isn¡¯t the only way to defeat poverty. And the Internet 

is not the only tool we have. But it has enormous potential.
To take advantage of this tool, some impoverished countries will have to get over their 

outdated anti-colonial prejudices with respect to foreign investment. Countries that still 

think foreign investment is an invasion of their sovereignty might well study the history 

of infrastructure (the basic structural foundations of a society) in the United States. 

When the United States built its industrial infrastructure, it didn¡¯t have the capital to 

do so. And that is why America¡¯s Second Wave infrastructure -- including roads, harbors, 

highways, ports and so on -- were built with foreign investment. The English, the Germans, 

the Dutch and the French were investing in Britain¡¯s former colony. They financed them. 

Immigrant Americans built them. Guess who owns them now? The Americans. I believe the same 

thing would be true in places like Brazil or anywhere else for that matter. The more 

foreign capital you have helping you build your Third Wave infrastructure, which today is 

an electronic infrastructure, the better off you¡¯re going to be. That doesn¡¯t mean lying 

down and becoming fooled, or letting foreign corporations run uncontrolled. But it does 

mean recognizing how important they can be in building the energy and telecom 

infrastructures needed to take full advantage of the Internet.
55.	Digital divide is something ________.
[A] getting worse because of the Internet
[B] the rich countries are responsible for
[C] the world must guard against
[D] considered positive today
56.	Governments attach importance to the Internet because it ________.
[A] offers economic potentials
[B] can bring foreign funds
[C] can soon wipe out world poverty
[D] connects people all over the world
57.	The writer mentioned the case of the United States to justify the policy of 

________.
[A] providing financial support overseas
[B] preventing foreign capital¡¯s control
[C] building industrial infrastructure
[D] accepting foreign investment
58.	It seems that now a country¡¯s economy depends much on ________.
[A] how well-developed it is electronically
[B] whether it is prejudiced against immigrants
[C] whether it adopts America¡¯s industrial pattern
[D] how much control it has over foreign corporations

Why do so many Americans distrust what they read in their newspapers? The American Society 

of Newspaper Editors is trying to answer this painful question. The organization is deep 

into a long self-analysis known as the journalism credibility project.
Sad to say, this project has turned out to be mostly low-level findings about factual 

errors and spelling and grammar mistakes, combined with lots of head-scratching puzzlement 

about what in the world those readers really want.
But the sources of distrust go way deeper. Most journalists learn to see the world through 

a set of standard templates (patterns) into which they plug each day¡¯s events. In other 

words, there is a conventional story line in the newsroom culture that provides a backbone 

and a ready-made narrative structure for otherwise confusing news.
There exists a social and cultural disconnect between journalists and their readers, which 

helps explain why the ¡°standard templates¡± of the newsroom seem alien to many readers. 

In a recent survey, questionnaires were sent to reporters in five middle-size cities 

around the country, plus one large metropolitan area. Then residents in these communities 

were phoned at random and asked the same questions.
Replies show that compared with other Americans, journalists are more likely to live in 

upscale neighborhoods, have maids, own Mercedeses, and trade stocks, and they¡¯re less 

likely to go to church, do volunteer work, or put down roots in a community.
Reporters tend to be part of a broadly defined social and cultural elite, so their work 

tends to reflect the conventional values of this elite. The astonishing distrust of the 

news media isn¡¯t rooted in inaccuracy or poor reportorial skills but in the daily clash 

of world views between reporters and their readers.
This is an explosive situation for any industry, particularly a declining one. Here is a 

troubled business that keeps hiring employees whose attitudes vastly annoy the customers. 

Then it sponsors lots of symposiums and a credibility project dedicated to wondering why 

customers are annoyed and fleeing in large numbers. But it never seems to get around to 

noticing the cultural and class biases that so many former buyers are complaining about. 

If it did, it would open up its diversity program, now focused narrowly on race and 

gender, and look for reporters who differ broadly by outlook, values, education, and 

class.
59.	What is the passage mainly about?
[A] needs of the readers all over the world
[B] causes of the public disappointment about newspapers
[C] origins of the declining newspaper industry
[D] aims of a journalism credibility project
60.	The results of the journalism credibility project turned out to be ________.
[A] quite trustworthy
[B] somewhat contradictory
[C] very illuminating
[D] rather superficial
61.	The basic problem of journalists as pointed out by the writer lies in their 

________.
[A] working attitude
[B] conventional lifestyle
[C] world outlook
[D] educational background
62.	Despite its efforts, the newspaper industry still cannot satisfy the readers owing 

to its ________.
[A] failure to realize its real problem
[B] tendency to hire annoying reporters
[C] likeliness to do inaccurate reporting
[D] prejudice in matters of race and gender
Text 4
The world is going through the biggest wave of mergers and acquisitions ever witnessed. 

The process sweeps from hyperactive America to Europe and reaches the emerging countries 

with unsurpassed might. Many in these countries are looking at this process and worrying: 

¡°Won¡¯t the wave of business concentration turn into an uncontrollable anti-competitive 

force?¡±
There¡¯s no question that the big are getting bigger and more powerful. Multinational 

corporations accounted for less than 20% of international trade in 1982. Today the figure 

is more than 25% and growing rapidly. International affiliates account for a fast-growing 

segment of production in economies that open up and welcome foreign investment. In 

Argentina, for instance, after the reforms of the early 1990s, multinationals went from 

43% to almost 70% of the industrial production of the 200 largest firms. This phenomenon 

has created serious concerns over the role of smaller economic firms, of national 

businessmen and over the ultimate stability of the world economy.
I believe that the most important forces behind the massive M&A wave are the same that 

underlie the globalization process: falling transportation and communication costs, lower 

trade and investment barriers and enlarged markets that require enlarged operations 

capable of meeting customer¡¯s demands. All these are beneficial, not detrimental, to 

consumers. As productivity grows, the world¡¯s wealth increases.
Examples of benefits or costs of the current concentration wave are scanty. Yet it is hard 

to imagine that the merger of a few oil firms today could re-create the same threats to 

competition that were feared nearly a century ago in the U.S., when the Standard Oil Trust 

was broken up. The mergers of telecom companies, such as WorldCom, hardly seem to bring 

higher prices for consumers or a reduction in the pace of technical progress. On the 

contrary, the price of communications is coming down fast. In cars, too, concentration is 

increasing -- witness Daimler and Chrysler, Renault and Nissan -- but it does not appear 

that consumers are being hurt.
Yet the fact remains that the merger movement must be watched. A few weeks ago, Alan 

Greenspan warned against the megamergers in the banking industry. Who is going to 

supervise, regulate and operate as lender of last resort with the gigantic banks that are 

being created? Won¡¯t multinationals shift production from one place to another when a 

nation gets too strict about infringements to fair competition? And should one country 

take upon itself the role of ¡°defending competition¡± on issues that affect many other 

nations, as in the U.S. vs. Microsoft case?
63.	What is the typical trend of businesses today?
[A] to take in more foreign funds
[B] to invest more abroad
[C] to combine and become bigger
[D] to trade with more countries
64.	According to the author, one of the driving forces behind M&A wave is ________.
[A] the greater customer demands
[B] a surplus supply for the market
[C] a growing productivity
[D] the increase of the world¡¯s wealth
65.	From Paragraph 4 we can infer that ________.
[A] the increasing concentration is certain to hurt consumers
[B] WorldCom serves as a good example of both benefits and costs
[C] the costs of the globalization process are enormous
[D] the Standard Oil Trust might have threatened competition
66.	Toward the new business wave, the writer¡¯s attitude can be said to be ________.
[A] optimistic
[B] objective
[C] pessimistic
[D] biased

When I decided to quit my full time employment it never occurred to me that I might become 

a part of a new international trend. A lateral move that hurt my pride and blocked my 

professional progress prompted me to abandon my relatively high profile career although, 

in the manner of a disgraced government minister, I covered my exit by claiming ¡°I wanted 

to spend more time with my family¡±.
Curiously, some two-and-a-half years and two novels later, my experiment in what the 

Americans term ¡°downshifting¡± has turned my tired excuse into an absolute reality. I 

have been transformed from a passionate advocate of the philosophy of ¡°having it all,¡± 

preached by Linda Kelsey for the past seven years in the page of She magazine, into a 

woman who is happy to settle for a bit of everything.
I have discovered, as perhaps Kelsey will after her much-publicized resignation from the 

editorship of She after a build-up of stress, that abandoning the doctrine of ¡°juggling 

your life,¡± and making the alternative move into ¡°downshifting¡± brings with it far 

greater rewards than financial success and social status. Nothing could persuade me to 

return to the kind of life Kelsey used to advocate and I once enjoyed: 12-hour working 

days, pressured deadlines, the fearful strain of office politics and the limitations of 

being a parent on ¡°quality time¡±.
In America, the move away from juggling to a simpler, less materialistic lifestyle is a 

well-established trend. Downshifting -- also known in America as ¡°voluntary simplicity¡± 

-- has, ironically, even bred a new area of what might be termed anti-consumerism. There 

are a number of best-selling downshifting self-help books for people who want to simplify 

their lives; there are newsletters, such as The Tightwad Gazette, that give hundreds of 

thousands of Americans useful tips on anything from recycling their cling-film to making 

their own soap; there are even support groups for those who want to achieve the mid-¡¯90s 

equivalent of dropping out.
While in America the trend started as a reaction to the economic decline -- after the mass 

redundancies caused by downsizing in the late ¡¯80s -- and is still linked to the politics 

of thrift, in Britain, at least among the middle-class downshifters of my acquaintance, we 

have different reasons for seeking to simplify our lives.
For the women of my generation who were urged to keep juggling through the ¡¯80s, 

downshifting in the mid-¡¯90s is not so much a search for the mythical good life -- 

growing your own organic vegetables, and risking turning into one -- as a personal 

recognition of your limitations.
67.	Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 1?
[A] Full-time employment is a new international trend.

[D] The writer was only too eager to spend more time with her family.
68.	The writer¡¯s experiment shows that downshifting ________.
[A] enables her to realize her dream
[B] helps her mold a new philosophy of life
[C] prompts her to abandon her high social status
[D] leads her to accept the doctrine of She magazine
69.	¡°Juggling one¡¯s life¡± probably means living a life characterized by ________.
[A] non-materialistic lifestyle
[B] a bit of everything
[C] extreme stress
[D] anti-consumerism
70.	According to the passage, downshifting emerged in the U.S. as a result of 

________.
[A] the quick pace of modern life
[B] man¡¯s adventurous spirit
[C] man¡¯s search for mythical experiences
[D] the economic situation
Section IV	English-Chinese Translation
Directions:
Read the following passage carefully and then translate the underlined sentences into 

Chinese. Your translation must be written neatly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (15 points)
In less than 30 years¡¯ time the Star Trek holodeck will be a reality. Direct links 

between the brain¡¯s nervous system and a computer will also create full sensory virtual 

environments, allowing virtual vacations like those in the film Total Recall.
71) There will be television chat shows hosted by robots, and cars with pollution monitors 

that will disable them when they offend. 72) Children will play with dolls equipped with 

personality chips, computers with in-built personalities will be regarded as workmates 

rather than tools, relaxation will be in front of smell-television, and digital age will 

have arrived.
According to BT¡¯s futurologist, Ian Pearson, these are among the developments scheduled 

for the first few decades of the new millennium (a period of 1,000 years), when 

supercomputers will dramatically accelerate progress in all areas of life.
73) Pearson has pieced together the work of hundreds of researchers around the world to 

produce a unique millennium technology calendar that gives the latest dates when we can 

expect hundreds of key breakthroughs and discoveries to take place. Some of the biggest 

developments will be in medicine, including an extended life expectancy and dozens of 

artificial organs coming into use between now and 2040.
Pearson also predicts a breakthrough in computer-human links. ¡°By linking directly to our 

nervous system, computers could pick up what we feel and, hopefully, simulate feeling too 

so that we can start to develop full sensory environments, rather like the holidays in 

Total Recall or the Star Trek holodeck,¡± he says. 74) But that, Pearson points out, is 

only the start of man-machine integration: ¡°It will be the beginning of the long process 

of integration that will ultimately lead to a fully electronic human before the end of the 

next century.¡±
Through his research, Pearson is able to put dates to most of the breakthroughs that can 

be predicted. However, there are still no forecasts for when faster-than-light travel will 

be available, or when human cloning will be perfected, or when time travel will be 

possible. But he does expect social problems as a result of technological advances. A boom 

in neighborhood surveillance cameras will, for example, cause problems in 2010, while the 

arrival of synthetic lifelike robots will mean people may not be able to distinguish 

between their human friends and the droids. 75) And home appliances will also become so 

smart that controlling and operating them will result in the breakout of a new 

psychological disorder -- kitchen rage.
Section V	Writing
76.	Directions:
Among all the worthy feelings of mankind, love is probably the noblest, but everyone has 

his/her own understanding of it.
There has been a discussion recently on the issue in a newspaper. Write an essay to the 

newspaper to
1) show your understanding of the symbolic meaning of the picture below,
2) give a specific example, and
3) give your suggestion as to the best way to show love.
You should write about 200 words on ANSWER SHEET 2. (20 points)
 
 


This picture is a symbol that tells us how we should use our love: our love is like a 

lamp; the darker the place, the brighter the light. Indeed, love is most precious when it 

is offered to someone who is in difficulty.
I can tell you a real story here. When I was a child, my family moved to the countryside. 

Among our new neighbors was a paralyzed woman. As an innocent child, I somehow showed some 

interest in her. When I had time, I would to see her. When I had something to eat, I would 

let her share with me. One day she suddenly said to me, tear in her eyes, ¡°I will bless 

you when I am in heaven.¡± I knew my love for her had worked wonders, for I had never 

heard her speaking and I thought she had lost her ability to speak. Her blessing may have 

really worked for I have been a lucky person in work and in life.
As far as I understand, love is sympathy and sincerity that needs not be expressed in 

terms of money or sweet words. As the proverb goes, ¡°a hand may smell fragrant when it 

gives roses to others.¡± I believe love is the most precious thing in the world and we 

should give it to those who need it most.

Comparisons were drawn between the development of television in the 20th century and the 

diffusion of printing in the 15th and 16th centuries. Yet much had happened  21 . As was 

discussed before, it was not  22  the 19th century that the newspaper became the 

dominant pre-electronic  23 , following in the wake of the pamphlet and the book and in 

the  24  of the periodical. It was during the same time that the communications 

revolution  25  up, beginning with transport, the railway, and leading  26  through the

It is generally recognized,  29 , that the introduction of the computer in the early 

20th century,  30  by the invention of the integrated circuit during the 1960s, 

radically changed the process,  31  its impact on the media was not immediately  32 . 

As time went by, computers became smaller and more powerful, and they became ¡°personal¡± 

too, as well as  33 , with display becoming sharper and storage  34  increasing. They 

were thought of, like people,  35  generations, with the distance between generations

It was within the computer age that the term ¡°information society¡± began to be widely 

used to describe the  37  within which we now live. The communications revolution has

If you intend using humor in your talk to make people smile, you must know how to identify 

shared experiences and problems. Your humor must be relevant to the audience and should 

help to show them that you are one of them or that you understand their situation and are 

in sympathy with their point of view. Depending on whom you are addressing, the problems 

will be different. If you are talking to a group of managers, you may refer to the 

disorganized methods of their secretaries; alternatively if you are addressing 

secretaries, you may want to comment on their disorganized bosses.
Here is an example, which I heard at a nurses¡¯ convention, of a story which works well 

because the audience all shared the same view of doctors. A man arrives in heaven and is 

being shown around by St. Peter. He sees wonderful accommodations, beautiful gardens, 

sunny weather, and so on. Everyone is very peaceful, polite and friendly until, waiting in 

a line for lunch, the new arrival is suddenly pushed aside by a man in a white coat, who 

rushes to the head of the line, grabs his food and stomps over to a table by himself. 

¡°Who is that?¡± the new arrival asked St. Peter. ¡°Oh, that¡¯s God,¡± came the reply, 

¡°but sometimes he thinks he¡¯s a doctor.¡±
If you are part of the group, which you are addressing, you will be in a position to know 

the experiences and problems which are common to all of you and it¡¯ll be appropriate for 

you to make a passing remark about the inedible canteen food or the chairman¡¯s notorious 

bad taste in ties. With other audiences you mustn¡¯t attempt to cut in with humor as they 

will resent an outsider making disparaging remarks about their canteen or their chairman. 

You will be on safer ground if you stick to scapegoats like the Post Office or the 

telephone system.
If you feel awkward being humorous, you must practice so that it becomes more natural. 

Include a few casual and apparently off-the-cuff remarks which you can deliver in a 

relaxed and unforced manner. Often it¡¯s the delivery which causes the audience to smile, 

so speak slowly and remember that a raised eyebrow or an unbelieving look may help to show 

that you are making a light-hearted remark.
Look for the humor. It often comes from the unexpected. A twist on a familiar quote ¡°If 

at first you don¡¯t succeed, give up¡± or a play on words or on a situation. Search for 

exaggeration and understatements. Look at your talk and pick out a few words or sentences 

which you can turn about and inject with humor.
41.	To make your humor work, you should ________.
[A] take advantage of different kinds of audience
[B] make fun of the disorganized people
[C] address different problems to different people
[D] show sympathy for your listeners
42.	The joke about doctors implies that, in the eyes of nurses, they are ________.
[A] impolite to new arrivals
[B] very conscious of their godlike role
[C] entitled to some privileges
[D] very busy even during lunch hours
43.	It can be inferred from the text that public services ________.
[A] have benefited many people
[B] are the focus of public attention
[C] are an inappropriate subject for humor
[D] have often been the laughing stock

[D] Different Humor Strategies
Text 2
Since the dawn of human ingenuity, people have devised ever more cunning tools to cope 

with work that is dangerous, boring, burdensome, or just plain nasty. That compulsion has 

resulted in robotics -- the science of conferring various human capabilities on machines. 

And if scientists have yet to create the mechanical version of science fiction, they have 

begun to come close.
As a result, the modern world is increasingly populated by intelligent gizmos whose 

presence we barely notice but whose universal existence has removed much human labor. Our 

factories hum to the rhythm of robot assembly arms. Our banking is done at automated 

teller terminals that thank us with mechanical politeness for the transaction. Our subway 

trains are controlled by tireless robot-drivers. And thanks to the continual 

miniaturization of electronics and micro-mechanics, there are already robot systems that 

can perform some kinds of brain and bone surgery with submillimeter accuracy -- far 

greater precision than highly skilled physicians can achieve with their hands alone.
But if robots are to reach the next stage of laborsaving utility, they will have to 

operate with less human supervision and be able to make at least a few decisions for 

themselves -- goals that pose a real challenge. ¡°While we know how to tell a robot to 

handle a specific error,¡± says Dave Lavery, manager of a robotics program at NASA, ¡°we 

can¡¯t yet give a robot enough ¡®common sense¡¯ to reliably interact with a dynamic world.

¡±
Indeed the quest for true artificial intelligence has produced very mixed results. Despite 

a spell of initial optimism in the 1960s and 1970s when it appeared that transistor 

circuits and microprocessors might be able to copy the action of the human brain by the 

year 2010, researchers lately have begun to extend that forecast by decades if not 

centuries.
What they found, in attempting to model thought, is that the human brain¡¯s roughly one 

hundred billion nerve cells are much more talented -- and human perception far more 

complicated -- than previously imagined. They have built robots that can recognize the 

error of a machine panel by a fraction of a millimeter in a controlled factory 

environment. But the human mind can glimpse a rapidly changing scene and immediately 

disregard the 98 percent that is irrelevant, instantaneously focusing on the monkey at the 

side of a winding forest road or the single suspicious face in a big crowd. The most 

advanced computer systems on Earth can¡¯t approach that kind of ability, and 

neuroscientists still don¡¯t know quite how we do it.
46.	Human ingenuity was initially demonstrated in ________.
[A] the use of machines to produce science fiction
[B] the wide use of machines in manufacturing industry
[C] the invention of tools for difficult and dangerous work
[D] the elite¡¯s cunning tackling of dangerous and boring work
47.	The word ¡°gizmos¡± (Line 1, Paragraph 2) most probably means ________.
[A] programs
[B] experts
[C] devices
[D] creatures
48.	According to the text, what is beyond man¡¯s ability now is to design a robot that 

can ________.
[A] fulfill delicate tasks like performing brain surgery
[B] interact with human beings verbally
[C] have a little common sense
[D] respond independently to a changing world
49.	Besides reducing human labor, robots can also ________.
[A] make a few decisions for themselves
[B] deal with some errors with human intervention
[C] improve factory environments
[D] cultivate human creativity
50.	The author uses the example of a monkey to argue that robots are ________.
[A] expected to copy human brain in internal structure
[B] able to perceive abnormalities immediately
[C] far less able than human brain in focusing on relevant information
[D] best used in a controlled environment

Could the bad old days of economic decline be about to return? Since OPEC agreed to 

supply-cuts in March, the price of crude oil has jumped to almost $26 a barrel, up from 

less than $10 last December. This near-tripling of oil prices calls up scary memories of 

the 1973 oil shock, when prices quadrupled, and 1979-80, when they also almost tripled. 

Both previous shocks resulted in double-digit inflation and global economic decline. So 

where are the headlines warning of gloom and doom this time?
The oil price was given another push up this week when Iraq suspended oil exports. 

Strengthening economic growth, at the same time as winter grips the northern hemisphere, 

could push the price higher still in the short term.
Yet there are good reasons to expect the economic consequences now to be less severe than 

in the 1970s. In most countries the cost of crude oil now accounts for a smaller share of 

the price of petrol than it did in the 1970s. In Europe, taxes account for up to four-

fifths of the retail price, so even quite big changes in the price of crude have a more 

muted effect on pump prices than in the past.
Rich economies are also less dependent on oil than they were, and so less sensitive to 

swings in the oil price. Energy conservation, a shift to other fuels and a decline in the 

importance of heavy, energy-intensive industries have reduced oil consumption. Software, 

consultancy and mobile telephones use far less oil than steel or car production. For each 

dollar of GDP (in constant prices) rich economies now use nearly 50% less oil than in 

1973. The OECD estimates in its latest Economic Outlook that, if oil prices averaged $22 a 

barrel for a full year, compared with $13 in 1998, this would increase the oil import bill 

in rich economies by only 0.25-0.5% of GDP. That is less than one-quarter of the income 

loss in 1974 or 1980. On the other hand, oil-importing emerging economies -- to which 

heavy industry has shifted -- have become more energy-intensive, and so could be more 

seriously squeezed.
One more reason not to lose sleep over the rise in oil prices is that, unlike the rises in 

the 1970s, it has not occurred against the background of general commodity-price inflation 

and global excess demand. A sizable portion of the world is only just emerging from 

economic decline. The Economist¡¯s commodity price index is broadly unchanging from a year 

ago. In 1973 commodity prices jumped by 70%, and in 1979 by almost 30%.
51.	The main reason for the latest rise of oil price is ________.
[A] global inflation
[B] reduction in supply
[C] fast growth in economy
[D] Iraq¡¯s suspension of exports
52.	It can be inferred from the text that the retail price of petrol will go up 

dramatically if ________.
[A] price of crude rises
[B] commodity prices rise
[C] consumption rises
[D] oil taxes rise
53.	The estimates in Economic Outlook show that in rich countries ________.
[A] heavy industry becomes more energy-intensive
[B] income loss mainly results from fluctuating crude oil prices
[C] manufacturing industry has been seriously squeezed
[D] oil price changes have no significant impact on GDP
54.	We can draw a conclusion from the text that ________.
[A] oil-price shocks are less shocking now
[B] inflation seems irrelevant to oil-price shocks
[C] energy conservation can keep down the oil prices
[D] the price rise of crude leads to the shrinking of heavy industry
55.	From the text we can see that the writer seems ________.
[A] optimistic
[B] sensitive
[C] gloomy
[D] scared
Text 4
The Supreme Court¡¯s decisions on physician-assisted suicide carry important implications 

for how medicine seeks to relieve dying patients of pain and suffering.
Although it ruled that there is no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide, the 

Court in effect supported the medical principle of ¡°double effect,¡± a centuries-old 

moral principle holding that an action having two effects -- a good one that is intended 

and a harmful one that is foreseen -- is permissible if the actor intends only the good 

effect.
Doctors have used that principle in recent years to justify using high doses of morphine 

to control terminally ill patients¡¯ pain, even though increasing dosages will eventually 

kill the patient.
Nancy Dubler, director of Montefiore Medical Center, contends that the principle will 

shield doctors who ¡°until now have very, very strongly insisted that they could not give 

patients sufficient mediation to control their pain if that might hasten death.¡±
George Annas, chair of the health law department at Boston University, maintains that, as 

long as a doctor prescribes a drug for a legitimate medical purpose, the doctor has done 

nothing illegal even if the patient uses the drug to hasten death. ¡°It¡¯s like surgery,¡± 

he says. ¡°We don¡¯t call those deaths homicides because the doctors didn¡¯t intend to 

kill their patients, although they risked their death. If you¡¯re a physician, you can 

risk your patient¡¯s suicide as long as you don¡¯t intend their suicide.¡±
On another level, many in the medical community acknowledge that the assisted-suicide 

debate has been fueled in part by the despair of patients for whom modern medicine has 

prolonged the physical agony of dying.
Just three weeks before the Court¡¯s ruling on physician-assisted suicide, the National 

Academy of Science (NAS) released a two-volume report, Approaching Death: Improving Care 

at the End of Life. It identifies the undertreatment of pain and the aggressive use of 

¡°ineffectual and forced medical procedures that may prolong and even dishonor the period 

of dying¡± as the twin problems of end-of-life care.
The profession is taking steps to require young doctors to train in hospices, to test 

knowledge of aggressive pain management therapies, to develop a Medicare billing code for 

hospital-based care, and to develop new standards for assessing and treating pain at the 

end of life.
Annas says lawyers can play a key role in insisting that these well-meaning medical 

initiatives translate into better care. ¡°Large numbers of physicians seem unconcerned 

with the pain their patients are needlessly and predictably suffering,¡± to the extent 

that it constitutes ¡°systematic patient abuse.¡± He says medical licensing boards ¡°must 

make it clear¡­ that painful deaths are presumptively ones that are incompetently managed 

and should result in license suspension.¡±
56.	From the first three paragraphs, we learn that ________.
[A] doctors used to increase drug dosages to control their patients¡¯ pain
[B] it is still illegal for doctors to help the dying end their lives
[C] the Supreme Court strongly opposes physician-assisted suicide
[D] patients have no constitutional right to commit suicide
57.	Which of the following statements is true according to the text?
[A] Doctors will be held guilty if they risk their patients¡¯ death.
[B] Modern medicine has assisted terminally ill patients in painless recovery.
[C] The Court ruled that high-dosage pain-relieving medication can be prescribed.
[D] A doctor¡¯s medication is no longer justified by his intentions.
58.	According to the NAS¡¯s report, one of the problems in end-of-life care is 

________.
[A] prolonged medical procedures
[B] inadequate treatment of pain
[C] systematic drug abuse
[D] insufficient hospital care
59.	Which of the following best defines the word ¡°aggressive¡± (Line 3, Paragraph 7)?
[A] Bold
[B] Harmful
[C] Careless
[D] Desperate
60.	George Annas would probably agree that doctors should be punished if they 

________.
[A] manage their patients incompetently
[B] give patients more medicine than needed
[C] reduce drug dosages for their patients
[D] prolong the needless suffering of the patients

Your translation should be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (10 points)
Almost all our major problems involve human behavior, and they cannot be solved by 

physical and biological technology alone. What is needed is a technology of behavior, but 

we have been slow to develop the science from which such a technology might be drawn. 61) 

One difficulty is that almost all of what is called behavioral science continues to trace 

behavior to states of mind, feelings, traits of character, human nature, and so on. 

Physics and biology once followed similar practices and advanced only when they discarded 

them. 62) The behavioral sciences have been slow to change partly because the explanatory 

items often seem to be directly observed and partly because other kinds of explanations 

have been hard to find. The environment is obviously important, but its role has remained 

obscure. It does not push or pull, it selects, and this function is difficult to discover 

and analyze. 63) The role of natural selection in evolution was formulated only a little 

more than a hundred years ago, and the selective role of the environment in shaping and 

maintaining the behavior of the individual is only beginning to be recognized and studied. 

As the interaction between organism and environment has come to be understood, however, 

effects once assigned to states of mind, feelings, and traits are beginning to be traced 

to accessible conditions, and a technology of behavior may therefore become available. It 

will not solve our problems, however, until it replaces traditional prescientific views, 

and these are strongly entrenched. Freedom and dignity illustrate the difficulty. 64) They 

are the possessions of the autonomous (self-governing) man of traditional theory, and they 

are essential to practices in which a person is held responsible for his conduct and given 

credit for his achievements. A scientific analysis shifts both the responsibility and the 

achievement to the environment. It also raises questions concerning ¡°values.¡± Who will 

use a technology and to what ends? 65) Until these issues are resolved, a technology of 

behavior will continue to be rejected, and with it possibly the only way to solve our 

problems.
Section IV	Writing
66.	Directions:
Study the following picture carefully and write an essay entitled ¡°Cultures -- National 

and International¡±.
In the essay you should
1) describe the picture and interpret its meaning, and
2) give your comment on the phenomenon.
You should write about 200 words neatly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (20 points)
 
An American girl in traditional Chinese costume (·þ×°)
 


Cultures -- national and international
As is shown in the picture, a young American girl is wearing traditional Chinese dress and 

ornaments and is smiling sweetly. It may be an ordinary picture, but it conveys deep and 

profound meaning: national culture is also international culture.
Ever since we opened our door to the world, we have attracted and influenced by things 

from other cultures, such as jeans, country music and fast food. We have shown such 

interest in them that some people, especially the younger generation, become crazy about 

them. The more exotic they are, the more fashionable they seem to be. Now, national 

culture begun to show its charm and gain popularity all over the world. Our national 

costume, just as shown in the picture, Beijing Opera, Cross Talk, for example, have won 

favor with a lot of foreigners.
As national culture becomes international culture, people in the world better understand 

each other. We are all villagers in this global village. Mutual respect and understanding 

make this world a better place to live in.

Text 1
Wild Bill Donovan would have loved the Internet. The American spymaster who built the 

Office of Strategic Services in the World War II and later laid the roots for the CIA was 

fascinated with information. Donovan believed in using whatever tools came to hand in the 

¡°great game¡± of espionage -- spying as a ¡°profession.¡± These days the Net, which has 

already re-made such everyday pastimes as buying books and sending mail, is reshaping 

Donovan¡¯s vocation as well.
The latest revolution isn¡¯t simply a matter of gentlemen reading other gentlemen¡¯s e-

mail. That kind of electronic spying has been going on for decades. In the past three or 

four years, the World Wide Web has given birth to a whole industry of point-and-click 

spying. The spooks call it ¡°open-source intelligence,¡± and as the Net grows, it is 

becoming increasingly influential. In 1995 the CIA held a contest to see who could compile 

the most data about Burundi. The winner, by a large margin, was a tiny Virginia company 

called Open Source Solutions, whose clear advantage was its mastery of the electronic 

world.
Among the firms making the biggest splash in this new world is Straitford, Inc., a private 

intelligence-analysis firm based in Austin, Texas. Straitford makes money by selling the 

results of spying (covering nations from Chile to Russia) to corporations like energy-

services firm McDermott International. Many of its predictions are available online at 

www.straitford.com.
Straitford president George Friedman says he sees the online world as a kind of mutually 

reinforcing tool for both information collection and distribution, a spymaster¡¯s dream. 

Last week his firm was busy vacuuming up data bits from the far corners of the world and 

predicting a crisis in Ukraine. ¡°As soon as that report runs, we¡¯ll suddenly get 500 new 

Internet sign-ups from Ukraine,¡± says Friedman, a former political science professor. 

¡°And we¡¯ll hear back from some of them.¡± Open-source spying does have its risks, of 

course, since it can be difficult to tell good information from bad. That¡¯s where 

Straitford earns its keep.
Friedman relies on a lean staff of 20 in Austin. Several of his staff members have 

military-intelligence backgrounds. He sees the firm¡¯s outsider status as the key to its 

success. Straitford¡¯s briefs don¡¯t sound like the usual Washington back-and-forthing, 

whereby agencies avoid dramatic declarations on the chance they might be wrong. 

Straitford, says Friedman, takes pride in its independent voice.
41.	The emergence of the Net has ________.
[A] received support from fans like Donovan
[B] remolded the intelligence services
[C] restored many common pastimes
[D] revived spying as a profession
42.	Donovan¡¯s story is mentioned in the text to ________.
[A] introduce the topic of online spying
[B] show how he fought for the U.S.
[C] give an episode of the information war
[D] honor his unique services to the CIA
43.	The phrase ¡°making the biggest splash¡± (Line 1, Paragraph 3) most probably means 

________.
[A] causing the biggest trouble
[B] exerting the greatest effort
[C] achieving the greatest success
[D] enjoying the widest popularity
44.	It can be learned from Paragraph 4 that ________.

Text 2
To paraphrase 18th-century statesman Edmund Burke, ¡°all that is needed for the triumph of 

a misguided cause is that good people do nothing.¡± One such cause now seeks to end 

biomedical research because of the theory that animals have rights ruling out their use in 

research. Scientists need to respond forcefully to animal rights advocates, whose 

arguments are confusing the public and thereby threatening advances in health knowledge 

and care. Leaders of the animal rights movement target biomedical research because it 

depends on public funding, and few people understand the process of health care research. 

Hearing allegations of cruelty to animals in research settings, many are perplexed that 

anyone would deliberately harm an animal.
For example, a grandmotherly woman staffing an animal rights booth at a recent street fair 

was distributing a brochure that encouraged readers not to use anything that comes from or 

is tested in animals¡ªno meat, no fur, no medicines. Asked if she opposed immunizations, 

she wanted to know if vaccines come from animal research. When assured that they do, she 

replied, ¡°Then I would have to say yes.¡± Asked what will happen when epidemics return, 

she said, ¡°Don¡¯t worry, scientists will find some way of using computers.¡± Such well-

meaning people just don¡¯t understand.
Scientists must communicate their message to the public in a compassionate, understandable 

way -- in human terms, not in the language of molecular biology. We need to make clear the 

connection between animal research and a grandmother¡¯s hip replacement, a father¡¯s 

bypass operation, a baby¡¯s vaccinations, and even a pet¡¯s shots. To those who are 

unaware that animal research was needed to produce these treatments, as well as new 

treatments and vaccines, animal research seems wasteful at best and cruel at worst.
Much can be done. Scientists could ¡°adopt¡± middle school classes and present their own 

research. They should be quick to respond to letters to the editor, lest animal rights 

misinformation go unchallenged and acquire a deceptive appearance of truth. Research 

institutions could be opened to tours, to show that laboratory animals receive humane 

care. Finally, because the ultimate stakeholders are patients, the health research 

community should actively recruit to its cause not only well-known personalities such as 

Stephen Cooper, who has made courageous statements about the value of animal research, but 

all who receive medical treatment. If good people do nothing, there is a real possibility 

that an uninformed citizenry will extinguish the precious embers of medical progress.
46.	The author begins his article with Edmund Burke¡¯s words to ________.
[A] call on scientists to take some actions
[B] criticize the misguided cause of animal rights
[C] warn of the doom of biomedical research
[D] show the triumph of the animal rights movement
47.	Misled people tend to think that using an animal in research is ________.
[A] cruel but natural
[B] inhuman and unacceptable
[C] inevitable but vicious
[D] pointless and wasteful
48.	The example of the grandmotherly woman is used to show the public¡¯s ________.
[A] discontent with animal research
[B] ignorance about medical science
[C] indifference to epidemics
[D] anxiety about animal rights
49.	The author believes that, in face of the challenge from animal rights advocates, 

scientists should ________.
[A] communicate more with the public
[B] employ hi-tech means in research
[C] feel no shame for their cause
[D] strive to develop new cures
50.	From the text we learn that Stephen Cooper is ________.
[A] a well-known humanist
[B] a medical practitioner
[C] an enthusiast in animal rights
[D] a supporter of animal research
Text 3
In recent years, railroads have been combining with each other, merging into supersystems, 

causing heightened concerns about monopoly. As recently as 1995, the top four railroads 

accounted for under 70 percent of the total ton-miles moved by rails. Next year, after a 

series of mergers is completed, just four railroads will control well over 90 percent of 

all the freight moved by major rail carriers.
Supporters of the new supersystems argue that these mergers will allow for substantial 

cost reductions and better coordinated service. Any threat of monopoly, they argue, is 

removed by fierce competition from trucks. But many shippers complain that for heavy bulk 

commodities traveling long distances, such as coal, chemicals, and grain, trucking is too 

costly and the railroads therefore have them by the throat.
The vast consolidation within the rail industry means that most shippers are served by 

only one rail company. Railroads typically charge such ¡°captive¡± shippers 20 to 30 

percent more than they do when another railroad is competing for the business. Shippers 

who feel they are being overcharged have the right to appeal to the federal government¡¯s 

Surface Transportation Board for rate relief, but the process is expensive, time-

consuming, and will work only in truly extreme cases.
Railroads justify rate discrimination against captive shippers on the grounds that in the 

long run it reduces everyone¡¯s cost. If railroads charged all customers the same average 

rate, they argue, shippers who have the option of switching to trucks or other forms of 

transportation would do so, leaving remaining customers to shoulder the cost of keeping up 

the line. It¡¯s a theory to which many economists subscribe, but in practice it often 

leaves railroads in the position of determining which companies will flourish and which 

will fail. ¡°Do we really want railroads to be the arbiters of who wins and who loses in 

the marketplace?¡± asks Martin Bercovici, a Washington lawyer who frequently represents 

shippers.
Many captive shippers also worry they will soon be hit with a round of huge rate 

increases. The railroad industry as a whole, despite its brightening fortunes, still does 

not earn enough to cover the cost of the capital it must invest to keep up with its 

surging traffic. Yet railroads continue to borrow billions to acquire one another, with 

Wall Street cheering them on. Consider the $10.2 billion bid by Norfolk Southern and CSX 

to acquire Conrail this year. Conrail¡¯s net railway operating income in 1996 was just 

$427 million, less than half of the carrying costs of the transaction. Who¡¯s going to pay 

for the rest of the bill? Many captive shippers fear that they will, as Norfolk Southern 

and CSX increase their grip on the market.
51.	According to those who support mergers, railway monopoly is unlikely because 

________.
[A] cost reduction is based on competition
[B] services call for cross-trade coordination
[C] outside competitors will continue to exist
[D] shippers will have the railway by the throat
52.	What is many captive shippers¡¯ attitude towards the consolidation in the rail 

industry?
[A] Indifferent.
[B] Supportive.
[C] Indignant.
[D] Apprehensive.
53.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________.
[A] shippers will be charged less without a rival railroad
[B] there will soon be only one railroad company nationwide
[C] overcharged shippers are unlikely to appeal for rate relief
[D] a government board ensures fair play in railway business
54.	The word ¡°arbiters¡± (Line 7, Paragraph 4) most probably refers to those 

________.
[A] who work as coordinators
[B] who function as judges
[C] who supervise transactions
[D] who determine the price
55.	According to the text, the cost increase in the rail industry is mainly caused by 

________.
[A] the continuing acquisition
[B] the growing traffic
[C] the cheering Wall Street
[D] the shrinking market
Text 4
It is said that in England death is pressing, in Canada inevitable and in California 

optional. Small wonder. Americans¡¯ life expectancy has nearly doubled over the past 

century. Failing hips can be replaced, clinical depression controlled, cataracts removed 

in a 30-minute surgical procedure. Such advances offer the aging population a quality of 

life that was unimaginable when I entered medicine 50 years ago. But not even a great 

health-care system can cure death -- and our failure to confront that reality now 

threatens this greatness of ours.
Death is normal; we are genetically programmed to disintegrate and perish, even under 

ideal conditions. We all understand that at some level, yet as medical consumers we treat 

death as a problem to be solved. Shielded by third-party payers from the cost of our care, 

we demand everything that can possibly be done for us, even if it¡¯s useless. The most 

obvious example is late-stage cancer care. Physicians -- frustrated by their inability to 

cure the disease and fearing loss of hope in the patient -- too often offer aggressive 

treatment far beyond what is scientifically justified.
In 1950, the U.S. spent $12.7 billion on health care. In 2002, the cost will be $1,540 

billion. Anyone can see this trend is unsustainable. Yet few seem willing to try to 

reverse it. Some scholars conclude that a government with finite resources should simply 

stop paying for medical care that sustains life beyond a certain age -- say 83 or so. 

Former Colorado governor Richard Lamm has been quoted as saying that the old and infirm ¡°

have a duty to die and get out of the way,¡± so that younger, healthier people can realize 

their potential.
I would not go that far. Energetic people now routinely work through their 60s and beyond, 

and remain dazzlingly productive. At 78, Viacom chairman Sumner Redstone jokingly claims 

to be 53. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O¡¯Connor is in her 70s, and former surgeon 

general C. Everett Koop chairs an Internet start-up in his 80s. These leaders are living 

proof that prevention works and that we can manage the health problems that come naturally 

with age. As a mere 68-year-old, I wish to age as productively as they have.
Yet there are limits to what a society can spend in this pursuit. As a physician, I know 

the most costly and dramatic measures may be ineffective and painful. I also know that 

people in Japan and Sweden, countries that spend far less on medical care, have achieved 

longer, healthier lives than we have. As a nation, we may be overfunding the quest for

Part B
Directions:
Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. 

Your translation should be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (10 points)
Human beings in all times and places think about their world and wonder at their place in 

it. Humans are thoughtful and creative, possessed of insatiable curiosity. 61) 

Furthermore, humans have the ability to modify the environment in which they live, thus 

subjecting all other life forms to their own peculiar ideas and fancies. Therefore, it is 

important to study humans in all their richness and diversity in a calm and systematic 

manner, with the hope that the knowledge resulting from such studies can lead humans to a 

more harmonious way of living with themselves and with all other life forms on this planet 

Earth.
¡°Anthropology¡± derives from the Greek words anthropos: ¡°human¡± and logos ¡°the study 

of.¡± By its very name, anthropology encompasses the study of all humankind.
Anthropology is one of the social sciences. 62) Social science is that branch of 

intellectual enquiry which seeks to study humans and their endeavors in the same reasoned, 

orderly, systematic, and dispassioned manner that natural scientists use for the study of 

natural phenomena.
Social science disciplines include geography, economics, political science, psychology, 

and sociology. Each of these social sciences has a subfield or specialization which lies 

particularly close to anthropology.
All the social sciences focus upon the study of humanity. Anthropology is a field-study 

oriented discipline which makes extensive use of the comparative method in analysis. 63) 

The emphasis on data gathered first-hand, combined with a cross-cultural perspective 

brought to the analysis of cultures past and present, makes this study a unique and 

distinctly important social science.
Anthropological analyses rest heavily upon the concept of culture. Sir Edward Tylor¡¯s 

formulation of the concept of culture was one of the great intellectual achievements of 

19th century science. 64) Tylor defined culture as ¡°¡­ that complex whole which includes 

belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as 

a member of society.¡± This insight, so profound in its simplicity, opened up an entirely 

new way of perceiving and understanding human life. Implicit within Tylor¡¯s definition is 

the concept that culture is learned, shared, and patterned behavior.
65) Thus, the anthropological concept of ¡°culture,¡± like the concept of ¡°set¡± in 

mathematics, is an abstract concept which makes possible immense amounts of concrete 

research and understanding.
Section IV	Writing
66.	Directions:
Study the following set of drawings carefully and write an essay in which you should
1) describe the set of drawings, interpret its meaning, and
2) point out its implications in our life.
You should write about 200 words neatly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (20 points)
 
 

As is shown in the two pictures, the same flower has different fate when put in different 

situations. When there is protection, the flower blooms beautifully. However, when exposed 

directly to rain and storm, the flower quickly withers. We can safely come to the 

conclusion that greenhouse flowers cannot withstand rain and storm.
The same is true with our children. As the one-child policy is adopted in China, more and 

more parents overprotect their children. With everything done for them and every need 

satisfied by their parents or grandparents, these only children seem to be healthy, happy 

and high-spirited. But when they leave home, they become disappointed and frustrated. 

Facing harsh things they have never experienced before, such as competition from peers, 

criticism from supervisors, pressure for deadlines and restriction for discipline, they 

will be at a loss, miserable or even desperate. In fact, the more protection they get from 

their parents, the less ability they acquire. Parents¡¯ love for their children turns out 

to be a disaster.
Children, like flowers, should be treated with care, but reasonable and sensible ways of 

doing things will help to bring about more fruitful results, if we not only love our 

children but also teach them how to love, our love will be passed down from generation to 

generation; if we not only solve problems for our children but also encourage them to 

solve problems, our diligence and ingenuity will make our life more meaningful and 

worthwhile.

Many theories concerning the causes of juvenile delinquency (crimes committed by young 

people) focus either on the individual or on society as the major contributing influence. 

Theories  21  on the individual suggest that children engage in criminal behavior  22  

they were not sufficiently penalized for previous misdeeds or that they have learned 

criminal behavior through  23  with others. Theories focusing on the role of society 

suggest that children commit crimes in  24  to their failure to rise above their 

socioeconomic status,  25  as a rejection of middle-class values.
Most theories of juvenile delinquency have focused on children from disadvantaged 

families,  26  the fact that children from wealthy homes also commit crimes. The latter 

may commit crimes  27  lack of adequate parental control. All theories, however, are 

tentative and are  28  to criticism.
Changes in the social structure may indirectly  29  juvenile crime rates. For example, 

changes in the economy that  30  to fewer job opportunities for youth and rising 

unemployment  31  make gainful employment increasingly difficult to obtain. The 

resulting discontent may in  32  lead more youths into criminal behavior.
Families have also  33  changes these years. More families consist of one-parent 

households or two working parents;  34 , children are likely to have less supervision at 

home  35  was common in the traditional family  36 . This lack of parental supervision 

is thought to be an influence on juvenile crime rates. Other  37  causes of offensive 

acts include frustration or failure in school, the increased  38  of drugs and alcohol, 

and the growing  39  of child abuse and child neglect. All these conditions tend to 

increase the probability of a child committing a criminal act,  40  a direct causal 

relationship has not yet been established.

Text 1
Hunting for a job late last year, lawyer Gant Redmon stumbled across CareerBuilder, a job 

database on the Internet. He searched it with no success but was attracted by the site¡¯s 

¡°personal search agent.¡± It¡¯s an interactive feature that lets visitors key in job 

criteria such as location, title, and salary, then E-mails them when a matching position 

is posted in the database. Redmon chose the keywords legal, intellectual property, and 

Washington, D.C. Three weeks later, he got his first notification of an opening. ¡°I 

struck gold,¡± says Redmon, who E-mailed his resume to the employer and won a position as 

in-house counsel for a company.
With thousands of career-related sites on the Internet, finding promising openings can be 

time-consuming and inefficient. Search agents reduce the need for repeated visits to the 

databases. But although a search agent worked for Redmon, career experts see drawbacks. 

Narrowing your criteria, for example, may work against you: ¡°Every time you answer a 

question you eliminate a possibility.¡± says one expert.
For any job search, you should start with a narrow concept¡ªwhat you think you want to do 

-- then broaden it. ¡°None of these programs do that,¡± says another expert. ¡°There¡¯s no 

career counseling implicit in all of this.¡± Instead, the best strategy is to use the 

agent as a kind of tip service to keep abreast of jobs in a particular database; when you 

get E-mail, consider it a reminder to check the database again. ¡°I would not rely on 

agents for finding everything that is added to a database that might interest me,¡± says 

the author of a job-searching guide.
Some sites design their agents to tempt job hunters to return. When CareerSite¡¯s agent 

sends out messages to those who have signed up for its service, for example, it includes 

only three potential jobs -- those it considers the best matches. There may be more 

matches in the database; job hunters will have to visit the site again to find them -- and 

they do. ¡°On the day after we send our messages, we see a sharp increase in our traffic,

¡± says Seth Peets, vice president of marketing for CareerSite.
Even those who aren¡¯t hunting for jobs may find search agents worthwhile. Some use them 

to keep a close watch on the demand for their line of work or gather information on 

compensation to arm themselves when negotiating for a raise. Although happily employed, 

Redmon maintains his agent at CareerBuilder. ¡°You always keep your eyes open,¡± he says. 

Working with a personal search agent means having another set of eyes looking out for you.
41.	How did Redmon find his job?
[A] By searching openings in a job database.
[B] By posting a matching position in a database.
[C] By using a special service of a database.
[D] By E-mailing his resume to a database.
42.	Which of the following can be a disadvantage of search agents?
[A] Lack of counseling.
[B] Limited number of visits.
[C] Lower efficiency.
[D] Fewer successful matches.
43.	The expression ¡°tip service¡± (Line 4, Paragraph 3) most probably means ________.
[A] advisory
[B] compensation
[C] interaction
[D] reminder
44.	Why does CareerSite¡¯s agent offer each job hunter only three job options?
[A] To focus on better job matches.
[B] To attract more returning visits.
[C] To reserve space for more messages.
[D] To increase the rate of success.
45.	Which of the following is true according to the text?
[A] Personal search agents are indispensable to job-hunters.
[B] Some sites keep E-mailing job seekers to trace their demands.
[C] Personal search agents are also helpful to those already employed.
[D] Some agents stop sending information to people once they are employed.

Over the past century, all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been condemned or 

made illegal. But one insidious form continues to thrive: alphabetism. This, for those as 

yet unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames 

begin with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.
It has long been known that a taxi firm called AAAA cars has a big advantage over Zodiac 

cars when customers thumb through their phone directories. Less well known is the 

advantage that Adam Abbott has in life over Zo? Zysman. English names are fairly evenly 

spread between the halves of the alphabet. Yet a suspiciously large number of top people 

have surnames beginning with letters between A and K.
Thus the American president and vice-president have surnames starting with B and C 

respectively; and 26 of George Bush¡¯s predecessors (including his father) had surnames in 

the first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking, six 

of the seven heads of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged 

(Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, Chr¨¦tien and Koizumi). The world¡¯s three top central 

bankers (Greenspan, Duisenberg and Hayami) are all close to the top of the alphabet, even 

if one of them really uses Japanese characters. As are the world¡¯s five richest men 

(Gates, Buffett, Allen, Ellison and Albrecht).
Can this merely be coincidence? One theory, dreamt up in all the spare time enjoyed by the 

alphabetically disadvantaged, is that the rot sets in early. At the start of the first 

year in infant school, teachers seat pupils alphabetically from the front, to make it 

easier to remember their names. So short-sighted Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row, 

and is rarely asked the improving questions posed by those insensitive teachers. At the 

time the alphabetically disadvantaged may think they have had a lucky escape. Yet the 

result may be worse qualifications, because they get less individual attention, as well as 

less confidence in speaking publicly.
The humiliation continues. At university graduation ceremonies, the ABCs proudly get their 

awards first; by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are literally having a ZZZ. 

Shortlists for job interviews, election ballot papers, lists of conference speakers and 

attendees: all tend to be drawn up alphabetically, and their recipients lose interest as 

they plough through them.
46.	What does the author intend to illustrate with AAA A cars and Zodiac cars?
[A] A kind of overlooked inequality.
[B] A type of conspicuous bias.
[C] A type of personal prejudice.
[D] A kind of brand discrimination.
47.	What can we infer from the first three paragraphs?
[A] In both East and West, names are essential to success.
[B] The alphabet is to blame for the failure of Zo? Zysman.
[C] Customers often pay a lot of attention to companies¡¯ names.
[D] Some form of discrimination is too subtle to recognize.
48.	The 4th paragraph suggests that ________.
[A] questions are often put to the more intelligent students
[B] alphabetically disadvantaged students often escape from class
[C] teachers should pay attention to all of their students
[D] students should be seated according to their eyesight
49.	What does the author mean by ¡°most people are literally having a ZZZ¡± (Lines 2-

3, Paragraph 5)?
[A] They are getting impatient.
[B] They are noisily dozing off.
[C] They are feeling humiliated.
[D] They are busy with word puzzles.
50.	Which of the following is true according to the text?
[A] People with surnames beginning with N to Z are often ill-treated.
[B] VIPs in the Western world gain a great deal from alphabetism.
[C] The campaign to eliminate alphabetism still has a long way to go.
[D] Putting things alphabetically may lead to unintentional bias.

When it comes to the slowing economy, Ellen Spero isn¡¯t biting her nails just yet. But 

the 47-year-old manicurist isn¡¯t cutting, filling or polishing as many nails as she¡¯d 

like to, either. Most of her clients spend $12 to $50 weekly, but last month two longtime 

customers suddenly stopped showing up. Spero blames the softening economy. ¡°I¡¯m a good 

economic indicator,¡± she says. ¡°I provide a service that people can do without when they

¡¯re concerned about saving some dollars.¡± So Spero is downscaling, shopping at middle-

brow Dillard¡¯s department store near her suburban Cleveland home, instead of Neiman 

Marcus. ¡°I don¡¯t know if other clients are going to abandon me, too.¡± she says.
Even before Alan Greenspan¡¯s admission that America¡¯s red-hot economy is cooling, lots 

of working folks had already seen signs of the slowdown themselves. From car dealerships 

to Gap outlets, sales have been lagging for months as shoppers temper their spending. For 

retailers, who last year took in 24 percent of their revenue between Thanksgiving and 

Christmas, the cautious approach is coming at a crucial time. Already, experts say, 

holiday sales are off 7 percent from last year¡¯s pace. But don¡¯t sound any alarms just 

yet. Consumers seem only mildly concerned, not panicked, and many say they remain 

optimistic about the economy¡¯s long-term prospects, even as they do some modest belt-

tightening.
Consumers say they¡¯re not in despair because, despite the dreadful headlines, their own 

fortunes still feel pretty good. Home prices are holding steady in most regions. In 

Manhattan, ¡°there¡¯s a new gold rush happening in the $4 million to $10 million range, 

predominantly fed by Wall Street bonuses,¡± says broker Barbara Corcoran. In San 

Francisco, prices are still rising even as frenzied overbidding quiets. ¡°Instead of 20 to 

30 offers, now maybe you only get two or three,¡± says John Tealdi, a Bay Area real-estate 

broker. And most folks still feel pretty comfortable about their ability to find and keep 

a job.
Many folks see silver linings to this slowdown. Potential home buyers would cheer for 

lower interest rates. Employers wouldn¡¯t mind a little fewer bubbles in the job market. 

Many consumers seem to have been influenced by stock-market swings, which investors now 

view as a necessary ingredient to a sustained boom. Diners might see an upside, too. 

Getting a table at Manhattan¡¯s hot new Alain Ducasse restaurant used to be impossible. 

Not anymore. For that, Greenspan & Co. may still be worth toasting.
51.	By ¡°Ellen Spero isn¡¯t biting her nails just yet¡± (Lines 1-2, Paragraph 1), the 

author means ________.
[A] Spero can hardly maintain her business
[B] Spero is too much engaged in her work
[C] Spero has grown out of her bad habit
[D] Spero is not in a desperate situation
52.	How do the public feel about the current economic situation?
[A] Optimistic.
[B] Confused.
[C] Carefree.
[D] Panicked.
53.	When mentioning ¡°the $4 million to $10 million range¡± (Lines 3-4, Paragraph 3) 

the author is talking about ________.
[A] gold market
[B] real estate
[C] stock exchange
[D] venture investment
54.	Why can many people see ¡°silver linings¡± to the economic slowdown?
[A] They would benefit in certain ways.
[B] The stock market shows signs of recovery.
[C] Such a slowdown usually precedes a boom.
[D] The purchasing power would be enhanced.
55.	To which of the following is the author likely to agree?
[A] A new boom, on the horizon.
[B] Tighten the belt, the single remedy.
[C] Caution all right, panic not.
[D] The more ventures, the more chances.
Text 4
Americans today don¡¯t place a very high value on intellect. Our heroes are athletes, 

entertainers, and entrepreneurs, not scholars. Even our schools are where we send our 

children to get a practical education -- not to pursue knowledge for the sake of 

knowledge. Symptoms of pervasive anti-intellectualism in our schools aren¡¯t difficult to 

find.
¡°Schools have always been in a society where practical is more important than 

intellectual,¡± says education writer Diane Ravitch. ¡°Schools could be a counterbalance.

¡± Ravitch¡¯s latest book, Left Back: A Century of Failed School Reforms, traces the roots 

of anti-intellectualism in our schools, concluding they are anything but a counterbalance 

to the American distaste for intellectual pursuits.
But they could and should be. Encouraging kids to reject the life of the mind  leaves them 

vulnerable to exploitation and control. Without the ability to think critically, to defend 

their ideas and understand the ideas of others, they cannot fully participate in our 

democracy. Continuing along this path, says writer Earl Shorris, ¡°We will become a 

second-rate country. We will have a less civil society.¡±
¡°Intellect is resented as a form of power or privilege,¡± writes historian and professor 

Richard Hofstadter in Anti-Intellectualism in American Life, a Pulitzer-Prize winning book 

on the roots of anti-intellectualism in US politics, religion, and education. From the 

beginning of our history, says Hofstadter, our democratic and populist urges have driven 

us to reject anything that smells of elitism. Practicality, common sense, and native 

intelligence have been considered more noble qualities than anything you could learn from 

a book.
Ralph Waldo Emerson and other Transcendentalist philosophers thought schooling and 

rigorous book learning put unnatural restraints on children: ¡°We are shut up in schools 

and college recitation rooms for 10 or 15 years and come out at last with a bellyful of 

words and do not know a thing.¡± Mark Twain¡¯s Huckleberry Finn exemplified American 

anti-intellectualism. Its hero avoids being civilized -- going to school and learning to 

read -- so he can preserve his innate goodness.
Intellect, according to Hofstadter, is different from native intelligence, a quality we 

reluctantly admire. Intellect is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of the 

mind. Intelligence seeks to grasp, manipulate, re-order, and adjust, while intellect 

examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes and imagines.
School remains a place where intellect is mistrusted. Hofstadter says our country¡¯s 

educational system is in the grips of people who ¡°joyfully and militantly proclaim their 

hostility to intellect and their eagerness to identify with children who show the least 

intellectual promise.¡±
56.	What do American parents expect their children to acquire in school?
[A] The habit of thinking independently.
[B] Profound knowledge of the world.

The relation of language and mind has interested philosophers for many centuries. 61) The 

Greeks assumed that the structure of language had some connection with the process of 

thought, which took root in Europe long before people realized how diverse languages could 

be.
Only recently did linguists begin the serious study of languages that were very different 

from their own. Two anthropologist-linguists, Franz Boas and Edward Sapir, were pioneers 

in describing many native languages of North and South America during the first half of 

the twentieth century. 62) We are obliged to them because some of these languages have 

since vanished, as the peoples who spoke them died out or became assimilated and lost 

their native languages. Other linguists in the earlier part of this century, however, who 

were less eager to deal with bizarre data from ¡°exotic¡± language, were not always so 

grateful. 63) The newly described languages were often so strikingly different from the 

well studied languages of Europe and Southeast Asia that some scholars even accused Boas 

and Sapir of fabricating their data. Native American languages are indeed different, so 

much so in fact that Navajo could be used by the US military as a code during World War II 

to send secret messages.
Sapir¡¯s pupil, Benjamin Lee Whorf, continued the study of American Indian languages. 64) 

Being interested in the relationship of language and thought, Whorf developed the idea 

that the structure of language determines the structure of habitual thought in a society. 

He reasoned that because it is easier to formulate certain concepts and not others in a 

given language, the speakers of that language think along one track and not along another. 

65) Whorf came to believe in a sort of linguistic determinism which, in its strongest 

form, states that language imprisons the mind, and that the grammatical patterns in a 

language can produce far-reaching consequences for the culture of a society. Later, this 

idea became to be known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, but this term is somewhat 

inappropriate. Although both Sapir and Whorf emphasized the diversity of languages, Sapir 

himself never explicitly supported the notion of linguistic determinism.

Look at this picture. A man is running toward the end of a race, sweating all over. 

Perhaps there is nothing special about the man and the race, yet the end line leaves a 

deep impression on us for it is both ¡°finish line¡± and ¡°starting line¡± if we look at it 

from a different angle.
The picture tells us a lot about life. An ordinary runner may think that his achievement 

calls for celebration for he has reached his goal. But an ambitious runner will well 

realize that his success is the starting point for a new race. Obviously, the way we look 

at things determines how far we will go. If we feel satisfied with the ability to read and 

write, perhaps we will not strive to get a college education. Again, if we think a 

Bachelor's degree is quite enough, we will not take pains to pass the examination for 

postgraduate. Life is just like an endless race. If we don¡¯t prepare for new races, we 

are either disqualified from the race or surpassed by others. That¡¯s why the finish line 

is also a starting line.
I like this picture. I may have been running this endless race, but I have been pushed 

forward by my parents or people around me. From now on, I will become more active and take 

the initiative, for the picture has really enlightened me.

The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be insensitive smellers 

compared with animals,  1  this is largely because,  2  animals, we stand upright. This 

means that our noses are  3  to perceiving those smells which float through the air,  4

  the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. In fact,  5 , we are extremely 

sensitive to smells,  6  we do not generally realize it. Our noses are capable of  7  

human smells even when these are  8  to far below one part in one million.
Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not another,  9  

others are sensitive to the smells of both flowers. This may be because some people do not 

have the genes necessary to generate  10  smell receptors in the nose. These receptors 

are the cells which sense smells and send  11  to the brain. However, it has been found 

that even people insensitive to a certain smell  12  can suddenly become sensitive to it 

when  13  to it often enough.
The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that the brain finds it  14  to 

keep all smell receptors working all the time but can  15  new receptors if necessary. 

This may  16  explain why we are not usually sensitive to our own smells¡ªwe simply do 

not need to be. We are not  17  of the usual smell of our own house, but we  18  new 

smells when we visit someone else¡¯s. The brain finds it best to keep smell receptors  19

Text 1
Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a 

colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you 

might even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as ¡°all too human,¡± with the 

underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed 

sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in 

Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that it is all too 

monkey, as well.
The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. 

They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above 

all, like their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the 

value of ¡°goods and services¡± than males.
Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan¡¯s and Dr. de Waal¡¯s 

study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. 

Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. 

However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each 

could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became 

markedly different.
In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So 

when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to 

hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to 

provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the 

researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the 

mere presence of a grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was 

enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.
The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. 

In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to 

be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous 

indignation, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward 

completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, 

whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether 

it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, 

an unanswered question.
21.	In the opening paragraph, the author introduces his topic by ________.
[A] posing a contrast
[B] justifying an assumption
[C] making a comparison
[D] explaining a phenomenon
22.	The statement ¡°it is all too monkey¡± (Last line, Paragraph l) implies that 

________.
[A] monkeys are also outraged by slack rivals
[B] resenting unfairness is also monkeys¡¯ nature
[C] monkeys, like humans, tend to be jealous of each other
[D] no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions
23.	Female capuchin monkeys were chosen for the research most probably because they 

are ________.
[A] more inclined to weigh what they get
[B] attentive to researchers¡¯ instructions
[C] nice in both appearance and temperament

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the 

doubters insisted that we didn¡¯t know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the 

science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the 

government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over 

three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.
There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken 

us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National 

Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth¡¯s atmosphere 

is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that 

we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce 

Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel¡¯s report: ¡°Science never has 

all the answers. But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, 

and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best 

judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions.

¡±
Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about 

global warming is incomplete, that it¡¯s OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we 

know for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it 

may be too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an 

insurance policy now.
Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it¡¯s obvious that a 

majority of the president¡¯s advisers still don¡¯t take global warming seriously. Instead 

of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research -- a classic case of 

¡°paralysis by analysis.¡±
To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper 

atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration 

won¡¯t take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning 

conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which 

would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. Many see that 

the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. 

If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be 

environmentally sound.

[A] there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between smoking and death
[B] the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was insignificant
[C] people had the freedom to choose their own way of life
[D] antismoking people were usually talking nonsense
27.	According to Bruce Alberts, science can serve as ________.

Text 3
Of all the components of a good night¡¯s sleep, dreams seem to be least within our 

control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people 

speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the 

disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists 

had switched to thinking of them as just ¡°mental noise¡± -- the random byproducts of the 

neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part 

of the mind¡¯s emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is ¡°off-line.¡± And 

one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only 

harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better, 

¡°It¡¯s your dream,¡± says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago¡¯s Medical 

Center. ¡°If you don¡¯t like it, change it.¡±
Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid 

eye movement) sleep -- when most vivid dreams occur -- as it is when fully awake, says Dr, 

Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally 

involved; the limbic system (the ¡°emotional brain¡±) is especially active, while the 

prefrontal cortex (the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. ¡°We wake 

up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day.¡± says 

Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.
The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in Cartwright¡¯s clinic. 

Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier 

ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings 

generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don¡¯t 

always think about the emotional significance of the day¡¯s events -- until, it appears, 

we begin to dream.
And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise 

conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, identify what is 

upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead; the next time 

it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can 

learn to, literally, do it in their sleep.
At the end of the day, there¡¯s probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at 

all unless they keep us from sleeping or ¡°we wake up in a panic,¡± Cartwright says. 

Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people

¡¯s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist. 

For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep -- or 

rather dream -- on it and you¡¯ll feel better in the morning.
31.	Researchers have come to believe that dreams ________.
[A] can be modified in their courses
[B] are susceptible to emotional changes
[C] reflect our innermost desires and fears
[D] are a random outcome of neural repairs

34.	Cartwright seems to suggest that ________.
[A] waking up in time is essential to the ridding of bad dreams
[B] visualizing bad dreams helps bring them under control
[C] dreams should be left to their natural progression
[D] dreaming may not entirely belong to the unconscious
35.	What advice might Cartwright give to those who sometimes have bad dreams?

Text 4
Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the 

English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In 

his latest book, Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We 

Should, Like, Care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and 

conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the 

decline of formal English.
Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against 

the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter¡¯s academic speciality is language history and 

change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of ¡°whom,¡± for example, to be natural and 

no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.
But the cult of the authentic and the personal, ¡°doing our own thing,¡± has spelt the 

death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought 

an elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded 

writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, 

the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. 

In both oral and written English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over 

craft.
Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the 

trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the 

question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that 

all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be 

powerfully expressive -- there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot 

convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think straight 

because we do not talk proper.
Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized 

poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem 

old-fashioned to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is 

not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms -- he is really grieving 

over the loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English ¡°on paper 

plates instead of china.¡± A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.
36.	According to McWhorter, the decline of formal English ________.
[A] is inevitable in radical education reforms
[B] is but all too natural in language development
[C] has caused the controversy over the counter-culture
[D] brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s

Canada¡¯s premiers (the leaders of provincial governments), if they have any breath left 

after complaining about Ottawa at their late July annual meeting, might spare a moment to 

do something, together, to reduce health-care costs.
They¡¯re all groaning about soaring health budgets, the fastest-growing component of which 

are pharmaceutical costs.
41.	________
What to do? Both the Romanow commission and the Kirby committee on health care -- to say 

nothing of reports from other experts -- recommended the creation of a national drug 

agency. Instead of each province having its own list of approved drugs, bureaucracy, 

procedures and limited bargaining power, all would pool resources, work with Ottawa, and 

create a national institution.
42.	________
But ¡°national¡± doesn¡¯t have to mean that. ¡°National¡± could mean interprovincial -- 

provinces combining efforts to create one body.
Either way, one benefit of a ¡°national¡± organization would be to negotiate better 

prices, if possible, with drug manufacturers. Instead of having one province -- or a 

series of hospitals within a province -- negotiate a price for a given drug on the 

provincial list, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of all provinces.
Rather than, say, Quebec, negotiating on behalf of seven million people, the national 

agency would negotiate on behalf of 31 million people. Basic economics suggests the 

greater the potential consumers, the higher the likelihood of a better price.
43.	________
A small step has been taken in the direction of a national agency with the creation of the 

Canadian Co-ordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, funded by Ottawa and the 

provinces. Under it, a Common Drug Review recommends to provincial lists which new drugs 

should be included. Predictably, and regrettably, Quebec refused to join.
A few premiers are suspicious of any federal-provincial deal-making. They (particularly 

Quebec and Alberta) just want Ottawa to fork over additional billions with few, if any, 

strings attached. That¡¯s one reason why the idea of a national list hasn¡¯t gone 

anywhere, while drug costs keep rising fast.
44.	________
Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow¡¯s report selectively, especially the parts about more 

federal money. Perhaps they should read what he had to say about drugs: ¡°A national drug 

agency would provide governments more influence on pharmaceutical companies in order to 

constrain the ever-increasing cost of drugs.¡±
45.	________
So when the premiers gather in Niagara Falls to assemble their usual complaint list, they 

should also get cracking about something in their jurisdiction that would help their 

budgets and patients.
[A] Quebec¡¯s resistance to a national agency is provincialist ideology. One of the first 

advocates for a national list was a researcher at Laval University. Quebec¡¯s Drug 

Insurance Fund has seen its costs skyrocket with annual increases from 14.3 per cent to 

26.8 per cent!
[B] Or they could read Mr. Kirby¡¯s report: ¡°the substantial buying power of such an 

agency would strengthen the public prescription-drug insurance plans to negotiate the 

lowest possible purchase prices from drug companies.¡±
[C] What does ¡°national¡± mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael Kirby recommended a 

federal-provincial body much like the recently created National Health Council.
[D] The problem is simple and stark: health-care costs have been, are, and will continue 

to increase faster than government revenues.
[E] According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, prescription drug costs 

have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall health-care spending. Part of the 

increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of treatments. Part of it 

arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is higher prices.
[F] So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show, they should prove they can run 

it, starting with an interprovincial health list that would end duplication, save 

administrative costs, prevent one province from being played off against another, and 

bargain for better drug prices.
[G] Of course, the pharmaceutical companies will scream. They like divided buyers; they 

can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs from one province to 

another. They can hope that, if one province includes a drug on its list, the pressure 

will cause others to include it on theirs. They wouldn¡¯t like a national agency, but 

self-interest would lead them to deal with it.

phase in European history. History and news become confused, and one¡¯s impressions tend 

to be a mixture of skepticism and optimism. 46) Television is one of the means by which 

these feelings are created and conveyed -- and perhaps never before has it served so much 

to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent events in Europe. The Europe 

that is now forming cannot be anything other than its peoples, their cultures and national 

identities. With this in mind we can begin to analyze the European television scene. 47) 

In Europe, as elsewhere, multi-media groups have been increasingly successful: groups 

which bring together television, radio, newspapers, magazines and publishing houses that 

work in relation to one another. One Italian example would be the Berlusconi group, while 

abroad Maxwell and Murdoch come to mind.
Clearly, only the biggest and most flexible television companies are going to be able to 

compete in such a rich and hotly-contested market. 48) This alone demonstrates that the 

television business is not an easy world to survive in, a fact underlined by statistics 

that show that out of eighty European television networks, no less than 50% took a loss in 

1989.
Moreover, the integration of the European community will oblige television companies to 

cooperate more closely in terms of both production and distribution.
49) Creating a ¡°European identity¡± that respects the different cultures and traditions 

which go to make up the connecting fabric of the Old Continent is no easy task and demands 

a strategic choice -- that of producing programs in Europe for Europe. This entails 

reducing our dependence on the North American market, whose programs relate to experiences 

and cultural traditions which are different from our own.
In order to achieve these objectives, we must concentrate more on co-productions, the 

exchange of news, documentary services and training. This also involves the agreements 

between European countries for the creation of a European bank for Television Production 

which, on the model of the European Investments Bank, will handle the finances necessary 

for production costs. 50) In dealing with a challenge on such a scale, it is no 

exaggeration to say ¡°United we stand, divided we fall¡± -- and if I had to choose a 

slogan it would be ¡°Unity in our diversity.¡± A unity of objectives that nonetheless 

respect the varied peculiarities of each country.

A Helpless Father
The picture ironically shows that a pitiable old man in rags is being helplessly kicked 

off by his three sons and a daughter, who all wear decent clothes. The father¡¯s negligent 

children are all guarding their home gates lest their old father ¡°roll into¡± their 

households. In other words, they four ignore their moral sense of assuming the 

responsibility for their old father even though they may be all living a satisfying life. 

That is a painful scene we often encounter in our daily life.
Sad to say, the moral decline of the younger generations may be a rather explosive 

situation in our modern society. People definitely have their living conditions improved 

by wider and wider margins, as evidenced by the four children¡¯s decent dressing, but 

their moral sense still remains sadly unchanged or in some cases becomes dramatically 

downgrading. Most people might have become too much self-centered, and even worse, they 

discard the tradition of giving respect to the elderly. They no longer care for their 

elders, let alone their neighbors or the disadvantaged; instead they try every means to 

avoid responsibility for other citizens. When one cares for others, one might even appear 

stupid or may even be distrusted.
Therefore, we have to take some useful measures to avoid the scene that is mentioned 

above. We must launch a variety of campaigns about the return to the good tradition of 

giving help and love to the elderly. Moreover, we must appeal to our government to 

establish some relevant laws to punish those who avoid their duties. The last but not the 

least, our respect for age is an indication of the progress of human society, as 

imperatives of traditions require. We sincerely wish that the old man could be welcome to 

any of the four households, elegantly dressed, and a smile on the face.

In spite of ¡°endless talk of difference,¡± American society is an amazing machine for 

homogenizing people. There is ¡°the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and 

the casualness and absence of deference¡± characteristic of popular culture. People are 

absorbed into ¡°a culture of consumption¡± launched by the 19th-century department stores 

that offered ¡°vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops 

catering to a knowledgeable elite,¡± these were stores ¡°anyone could enter, regardless of 

class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.¡± The mass 

media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.
Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether 

elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory 

Rodriguez reports that today¡¯s immigration is neither at unprecedented levels nor 

resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 

13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 

residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices 

of assimilation -- language, home ownership and intermarriage.
The 1990 Census revealed that ¡°a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most 

common countries of origin spoke English ¡®well¡¯ or ¡®very well¡¯ after ten years of 

residence.¡± The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. ¡°

By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant 

families.¡± Hence the description of America as a ¡°graveyard¡± for languages. By 1996 

foreign-born immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 

percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans.
Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics ¡°have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S.-born 

whites and blacks.¡± By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to 

non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian-American women are married to non-Asians.
Rodriguez notes that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars 

like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet ¡°some Americans fear that immigrants 

living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation¡¯s assimilative power.

¡±
Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big 

enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America¡¯s 

turbulent past, today¡¯s social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social 

environment.
21.	The word ¡°homogenizing¡± (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably means ________.
[A] identifying
[B] associating
[C] assimilating
[D] monopolizing
22.	According to the author, the department stores of the 19th century ________.
[A] played a role in the spread of popular culture
[B] became intimate shops for common consumers

[A] are resistant to homogenization
[B] exert a great influence on American culture
[C] are hardly a threat to the common culture

Text 2
Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry -- William Shakespeare -- but 

there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal 

Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the 

Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off 

the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway¡¯s Cottage, 

Shakespeare¡¯s birthplace and the other sights.
The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. 

They frankly dislike the RSC¡¯s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals 

and noisiness. It¡¯s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns 

their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise-making.
The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus -- and often 

take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side -- don¡¯t usually see the plays, 

and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers 

do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC 

contends, who bring in much of the town¡¯s revenue because they spend the night (some of 

them four or five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can 

take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.
The townsfolk don¡¯t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the 

subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless 

every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building 

its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, 

the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.
Anyway, the townsfolk can¡¯t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. 

(The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 

seats were 94 percent occupied all year long and this year they¡¯ll do better.) The 

reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.
It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people 

who are Stratford¡¯s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the 

sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) -- lean, pointed, 

dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the 

night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room 

tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.
26.	From the first two paragraphs, we learn that ________.
[A] the townsfolk deny the RSC¡¯s contribution to the town¡¯s revenue
[B] the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage
[C] the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms
[D] the townsfolk earn little from tourism
27.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________.
[A] the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately
[B] the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers
[C] the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers
[D] the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater
28.	By saying ¡°Stratford cries poor traditionally¡± (Line 2-3, Paragraph 4), the 

author implies that ________.
[A] Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects
[B] Stratford has long been in financial difficulties
[C] the town is not really short of money
[D] the townsfolk used to be poorly paid
29.	According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because ________.
[A] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending
[B] the company is financially ill-managed
[C] the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable
[D] the theatre attendance is on the rise
30.	From the text we can conclude that the author ________.
[A] is supportive of both sides
[B] favors the townsfolk¡¯s view
[C] takes a detached attitude
[D] is sympathetic to the RSC
Text 3
When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strange happened to the 

large animals. They suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived. The large, slow-

growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something 

similar could be happening in the oceans.
That the seas are being overfished has been known for years. What researchers such as 

Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have 

looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not 

attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish 

species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. 

According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators 

(animals that kill and eat other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% 

within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved 

again since then.
Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative. One reason for this is that 

fishing technology has improved. Today¡¯s vessels can find their prey using satellites and 

sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in 

the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be 

worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines 

would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been 

caught, since no baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an 

underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline 

fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a 

problem, because there are fewer sharks around now.
Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future 

management efforts must take into account. They believe the data support an idea current 

among marine biologists, that of the ¡°shifting baseline.¡± The notion is that people have 

failed to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have 

been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory 

suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped from a fishery comes when 

the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are 

well below that, which is a bad way to do business.
31.	The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest that ________.
[A] large animal were vulnerable to the changing environment
[B] small species survived as large animals disappeared
[C] large sea animals may face the same threat today
[D] slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones
32.	We can infer from Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm¡¯s paper that ________.
[A] the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%
[B] there are only half as many fisheries as there were 15 years ago
[C] the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original amount
[D] the number of larger predators dropped faster in new fisheries than in the old
33.	By saying "these figures are conservative" (Line 1, paragraph 3), Dr. Worm means 

that ________.
[A] fishing technology has improved rapidly
[B] the catch-sizes are actually smaller than recorded
[C] the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss
[D] the data collected so far are out of date
34.	Dr. Myers and other researchers hold that ________.
[A] people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time
[B] fisheries should keep their yields below 50% of the biomass
[C] the ocean biomass should be restored to its original level
[D] people should adjust the fishing baseline to the changing situation
35.	The author seems to be mainly concerned with most fisheries¡¯ ________.
[A] management efficiency
[B] biomass level
[C] catch-size limits
[D] technological application
Text 4
Many things make people think artists are weird. But the weirdest may be this: artists¡¯ 

only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.
This wasn¡¯t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best 

suited for expressing joy. But somewhere from the 19th century onward, more artists began 

seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all, boring, as we went from 

Wordsworth¡¯s daffodils to Baudelaire¡¯s flowers of evil.
You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen 

so much misery. But it¡¯s not as if earlier times didn¡¯t know perpetual war, disaster and 

the massacre of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too 

much damn happiness in the world today.
After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to 

depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the 

emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just 

an ideal but an ideology.
People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until 

exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass 

communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded 

worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. 

Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too.
Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not religious but 

commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all 

smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in 

perfect homes. And since these messages have an agenda -- to lure us to open our wallets 

-- they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable. ¡°Celebrate!¡± commanded the ads 

for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out it could increase the risk of heart 

attacks.
But what we forget -- what our economy depends on us forgetting -- is that happiness is 

more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest 

potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we 

need art to tell us, as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that 

everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It¡¯s 

a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.
36.	By citing the examples of poets Wordsworth and Baudelaire, the author intends to 

show that ________.
[A] poetry is not as expressive of joy as painting or music
[B] art grows out of both positive and negative feelings
[C] poets today are less skeptical of happiness
[D] artists have changed their focus of interest
37.	The word ¡°bummer¡± (Line 5, paragraph 5) most probably means something ________.
[A] religious
[B] unpleasant
[C] entertaining
[D] commercial
38.	In the author¡¯s opinion, advertising ________.
[A] emerges in the wake of the anti-happy art
[B] is a cause of disappointment for the general public
[C] replaces the church as a major source of information
[D] creates an illusion of happiness rather than happiness itself
39.	We can learn from the last paragraph that the author believes ________.
[A] happiness more often than not ends in sadness
[B] the anti-happy art is distasteful but refreshing
[C] misery should be enjoyed rather than denied
[D] the anti-happy art flourishes when economy booms
40.	Which of the following is true of the text?
[A] Religion once functioned as a reminder of misery.
[B] Art provides a balance between expectation and reality.
[C] People feel disappointed at the realities of modern society.
[D] Mass media are inclined to cover disasters and deaths.

ANSWER SHEET 1. (10 points)
On the north bank of the Ohio river sits Evansville, Ind., home of David Williams, 52, and 

of a riverboat casino (a place where gambling games are played). During several years of 

gambling in that casino, Williams, a state auditor earning $35,000 a year, lost 

approximately $175,000. He had never gambled before the casino sent him a coupon for $20 

worth of gambling.
He visited the casino, lost the $20 and left. On his second visit he lost $800. The casino 

issued to him, as a good customer, a "Fun Card", which when used in the casino earns 

points for meals and drinks, and enables the casino to track the user¡¯s gambling 

activities. For Williams, those activities become what he calls "electronic heroin".
(41) ________. In 1997 he lost $21,000 to one slot machine in two days. In March 1997 he 

lost $72,186. He sometimes played two slot machines at a time, all night, until the boat 

docked at 5 a.m., then went back aboard when the casino opened at 9 a.m. Now he is suing 

the casino, charging that it should have refused his patronage because it knew he was 

addicted. It did know he had a problem.
In March 1998 a friend of Williams¡¯s got him involuntarily confined to a treatment center 

for addictions, and wrote to inform the casino of Williams¡¯s gambling problem. The casino 

included a photo of Williams among those of banned gamblers, and wrote to him a ¡°cease 

admissions¡± letter. Noting the medical/psychological nature of problem gambling behavior, 

the letter said that before being readmitted to the casino he would have to present 

medical/psychological information demonstrating that patronizing the casino would pose no 

threat to his safety or well-being.
(42) ________.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the casino has 24 signs warning: ¡°Enjoy the fun... 

and always bet with your head, not over it.¡± Every entrance ticket lists a toll-free 

number for counseling from the Indiana Department of Mental Health. Nevertheless, Williams

¡¯s suit charges that the casino, knowing he was ¡°helplessly addicted to gambling,¡± 

intentionally worked to ¡°lure¡± him to ¡°engage in conduct against his will.¡± Well.
(43) ________.
The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders says 

¡°pathological gambling¡± involves persistent, recurring and uncontrollable pursuit less 

of money than of thrill of taking risks in quest of a windfall.
(44) ________. Pushed by science, or what claims to be science, society is reclassifying 

what once were considered character flaws or moral failings as personality disorders akin 

to physical disabilities.
(45) ________.
Forty-four states have lotteries, 29 have casinos, and most of these states are to varying 

degrees dependent on -- you might say addicted to -- revenues from wagering. And since the 

first Internet gambling site was created in 1995, competition for gamblers¡¯ dollars has 

become intense. The Oct. 28 issue of Newsweek reported that 2 million gamblers patronize 

1,800 virtual casinos every week. With $3.5 billion being lost on Internet wagers this 

year, gambling has passed pornography as the Web¡¯s most profitable business.
[A]	Although no such evidence was presented, the casino¡¯s marketing department

without being detected.
[B]	It is unclear what luring was required, given his compulsive behavior. And in what 

sense was his will operative?
[C]	By the time he had lost $5,000 he said to himself that if he could get back to 

even, he would quit. One night he won $5,500, but he did not quit.
[D]	Gambling has been a common feature of American life forever, but for a long time 

it was broadly considered a sin, or a social disease. Now it is a social policy: the most 

important and aggressive promoter of gambling in America is the government.
[E]	David Williams¡¯s suit should trouble this gambling nation. But don¡¯t bet on it.
[F]	It is worrisome that society is medicalizing more and more behavioral problems, 

often defining as addictions what earlier, sterner generations explained as weakness of 

will.
[G]	The anonymous, lonely, undistracted nature of online gambling is especially 

conducive to compulsive behavior. But even if the government knew how to move against 

Internet gambling, what would be its grounds for doing so?

Is it true that the American intellectual is rejected and considered of no account in his 

society? I am going to suggest that it is not true. Father Bruckberger told part of the 

story when he observed that it is the intellectuals who have rejected America. But they 

have done more than that. They have grown dissatisfied with the role of intellectual. It 

is they, not America, who have become anti-intellectual.
First, the object of our study pleads for definition. What is an intellectual? 46) I shall 

define him as an individual who has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life the 

activity of thinking in a Socratic (ËÕ¸ñÀ­µ×) way about moral problems. He explores such 

problems consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by asking factual questions, then 

by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action which seems appropriate in the 

light of the factual and moral information which he has obtained. 47) His function is 

analogous to that of a judge, who must accept the obligation of revealing in as obvious a 

manner as possible the course of reasoning which led him to his decision.
This definition excludes many individuals usually referred to as intellectuals -- the 

average scientist, for one. 48) I have excluded him because, while his accomplishments may 

contribute to the solution of moral problems, he has not been charged with the task of 

approaching any but the factual aspects of those problems. Like other human beings, he 

encounters moral issues even in the everyday performance of his routine duties -- he is 

not supposed to cook his experiments, manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. 49) But 

his primary task is not to think about the moral code which governs his activity, any more 

than a businessman is expected to dedicate his energies to an exploration of rules of 

conduct in business. During most of his waking life he will take his code for granted, as 

the businessman takes his ethics.
The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact that teaching has 

traditionally been the method whereby many intellectuals earn their living. 50) They may 

teach very well and more than earn their salaries, but most of them make little or no 

independent reflections on human problems which involve moral judgment. This description 

even fits the majority of eminent scholars. Being learned in some branch of human 

knowledge is one thing, living in "public and illustrious thoughts,¡± as Emerson would 

say, is something else.

As a college student who is studying and living in a good environment, I wish to 

contribute to Project Hope by offering financial assistance to a child in a remote area. 

Having conceived such a plan for a long time, I write this letter to request your help to 

recommend a proper candidate.
I wonder if it is convenient for you if three things concerning the child are taken into 

consideration. First, the child should come from Gansu Province, for I intend to help a 

child from my hometown. Second, it will be better if the child is a primary school 

student. I hope I will help him/her from the very beginning. In addition, he/she must be 

willing to return to his hometown to help built it after graduation from university.
My plan will be carried out as follows. On one hand, I will remit at least 2,000 Yuan in 

cash every year until he/she finishes his/her education before entering college. On the 

other hand, I decide to teach the child math and English in person during my summer 

vacation, which will surely be more beneficial to the child.
Your prompt help would be highly appreciated. And I am looking forward to your reply very 

soon.

How ironic the two pictures are in describing one of the most widespread social phenomena 

concerning idol adoration! In the first picture, a young man writes the name of Beckham on 

his face. In the second picture, another young man spends 300 Yuan in dealing with his 

hair to make himself look like Beckham.
The meaning conveyed in the two pictures reveals that in current China some young people 

are losing themselves. I am greatly shocked by the enthusiasm for this British football 

superstar shown by these two young men. Frankly speaking, things of this kind really 

happen among us. Some people, especially college students, do nothing but concentrate on 

imitating superstars. This does great harm to their study and growth. If we can¡¯t stop 

the worsening of this tendency, our own culture will be damaged, and we ourselves will be 

the ultimate victims.
From my point of view, a lot of measures should be taken to save our losing culture and 

re-find ourselves. In fact, some measures have already been taken. In my university, 

campaigns have been launched to educate people to pay more attention to our traditional 

culture and read more books instead of focusing on our appearances. As a result, we have 

witnessed some improvements but still there is a long way to go.

By 1830 the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies had become independent nations. The

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006¡¯s World Cup 

tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more 

likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If 

you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and 

professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.
What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain 

astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have 

higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more 

likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of 

the above.
Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he 

believes strongly in ¡°none of the above.¡± Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied 

nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own 

research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved 

memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. ¡°With the 

first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20,¡± 

Ericsson recalls. ¡°He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen 

to over 80 numbers.¡±
This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically 

determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive 

exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may 

exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each 

person ¡°encodes¡± the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information 

meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate 

practice entails more than simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific 

goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.
Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range 

of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance 

statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory 

experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait 

we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers ¨C 

whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer programming ¨C are nearly always made, 

not born.
21.	The birthday phenomenon found among soccer players is mentioned to
[A] stress the importance of professional training.
[B] spotlight the soccer superstars in the World Cup.
[C] introduce the topic of what makes expert performance.
[D] explain why some soccer teams play better than others.
22.	The word ¡°mania¡± (Line 4, Paragraph 2) most probably means
[A] fun.
[B] craze.
[C] hysteria.
[D] excitement.
23.	According to Ericsson, good memory
[A] depends on meaningful processing of information.
[B] results from intuitive rather than cognitive exercises.
[C] is determined by genetic rather than psychological factors.
[D] requires immediate feedback and a high degree of concentration.
24.	Ericsson and his colleagues believe that
[A] talent is a dominating factor for professional success.
[B] biographical data provide the key to excellent performance.
[C] the role of talent tends to be overlooked.
[D] high achievers owe their success mostly to nurture.

Text 2
For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column 

called ¡°Ask Marilyn.¡± People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had 

tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 ¨C the 

highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to 

envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among 

other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the 

average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What¡¯s the difference between love and fondness? Or 

what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It¡¯s not obvious how the capacity to 

visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that 

have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.
Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to 

be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it 

from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?
The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ 

tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: 

the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in 

adult and children¡¯s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are 

usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and 

the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant¡¯s are no longer possible, because 

scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than 

simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. Other 

standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record 

Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.
Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in 

school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article ¡°How Intelligent Is 

Intelligence Testing?¡±, Sternberg notes that traditional test best assess analytical and 

verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also 

critical to problem solving and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily 

predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ 

predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but 

under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with leadership ¨C that is, it 

predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking 

skill also matters, whether it¡¯s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.
26.	Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test?
[A] Answering philosophical questions.
[B] Folding or cutting paper into different shapes.
[C] Telling the differences between certain concepts.
[D] Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones.
27.	What can be inferred about intelligence testing from Paragraph 3?
[A] People no longer use IQ scores as an indicator of intelligence.
[B] More versions of IQ tests are now available on the Internet.
[C] The test contents and formats for adults and children may be different.
[D] Scientists have defined the important elements of human intelligence.
28.	People nowadays can no longer achieve IQ scores as high as vos Savant¡¯s because
[A] the scores are obtained through different computational procedures.
[B] creativity rather than analytical skills is emphasized now.
[C] vos Savant¡¯s case is an extreme one that will not repeat.
[D] the defining characteristic of IQ tests has changed.
29.	We can conclude from the last paragraph that
[A] test scores may not be reliable indicators of one¡¯s ability.
[B] IQ scores and SAT results are highly correlated.
[C] testing involves a lot of guesswork.
[D] traditional test are out of date.
30.	What is the author¡¯s attitude towards IQ tests?
[A] Supportive.

Text 3
During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard 

work and fair play to keep itself financially secure had been transformed by economic risk 

and new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a 

family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.
In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family 

economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social 

implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has 

risen as well. Today¡¯s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck 

status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of financial 

setback ¨C a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary 

earner got laid off or fell sick. This ¡°added-worker effect¡± could support the safety 

net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad 

times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra 

income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.
During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their 

retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are 

joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock market 

fluctuation, and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much 

of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a saving-account 

model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments 

depending on investment returns. For younger families, the picture is not any better. Both 

the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen ¨C and 

newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart 

workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families

¡¯ future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as 

the odds of having a weak elderly parent ¨C and all the attendant need for physical and 

financial assistance ¨C have jumped eightfold in just one generation.
From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less 

like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a 

frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already 

overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not 

be far behind.
31.	Today¡¯s double-income families are at greater financial risk in that
[A] the safety net they used to enjoy has disappeared.
[B] their chances of being laid off have greatly increased.
[C] they are more vulnerable to changes in family economics.
[D] they are deprived of unemployment or disability insurance.
32.	As a result of President Bush¡¯s reform, retired people may have
[A] a higher sense of security.
[B] less secured payments.
[C] less chance to invest.
[D] a guaranteed future.
33.	According to the author, health-savings plans will
[A] help reduce the cost of healthcare.
[B] popularize among the middle class.
[C] compensate for the reduced pensions.
[D] increase the families¡¯ investment risk.
34.	It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
[A] financial risks tend to outweigh political risks.
[B] the middle class may face greater political challenges.
[C] financial problems may bring about political problems.
[D] financial responsibility is an indicator of political status.
35.	Which of the following is the best title for this text?
[A] The Middle Class on the Alert
[B] The Middle Class on the Cliff
[C] The Middle Class in Conflict
[D] The Middle Class in Ruins

It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst 

accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a 

new problem threatens to earn them ¨C especially in America ¨C the sort of nasty headlines 

that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until 

now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich 

industries such as banking, telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on 

the boss¡¯s agenda in businesses of every variety.
Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year ¨C from organizations as 

diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International 

Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley ¨C have left managers hurriedly 

peering into their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential 

vulnerabilities.
¡°Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset,¡± says 

Haim Mendelson of Stanford University¡¯s business school. ¡°The ability to guard customer 

data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of 

shareholders.¡± Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting 

Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, 

suggested Eli Noam of New York¡¯s Columbia Business School. ¡°Setting the proper 

investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a 

technical one,¡± he says.
The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be 

obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is 

easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore ¨C and that few things are more likely to 

destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.
The current state of affairs may have been encouraged ¨C though not justified ¨C by the 

lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California 

recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when 

data went astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now 

doing the rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 

million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely 

important decision a day earlier by America¡¯s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts 

corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate 

data security.
36.	The statement ¡°It never rains but it pours¡± is used to introduce
[A] the fierce business competition.
[B] the feeble boss-board relations.
[C] the threat from news reports.
[D] the severity of data leakage.

[A] whether there is any weak point.
[B] what sort of data has been stolen.
[C] who is responsible for the leakage.
[D] how the potential spies can be located.
38.	In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the point that
[A] shareholders¡¯ interests should be properly attended to.
[B] information protection should be given due attention.
[C] businesses should enhance their level of accounting security.
[D] the market value of customer data should be emphasized.
39.	According to Paragraph 4, what puzzles the author is that some bosses fail to
[A] see the link between trust and data protection.
[B] perceive the sensitivity of personal data.
[C] realize the high cost of data restoration.
[D] appreciate the economic value of trust.
40.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that
[A] data leakage is more severe in Europe.
[B] FTC¡¯s decision is essential to data security.
[C] California takes the lead in security legislation.
[D] legal penalty is a major solution to data leakage.

Mothers and fathers can do a lot to ensure a safe landing in early adulthood for their 

kids. Even if a job¡¯s starting salary seems too small to satisfy an emerging adult¡¯s 

need for rapid content, the transition from school to work can be less of a setback if the 

start-up adult is ready for the move. Here are a few measures, drawn from my book Ready or 

Not, Here Life Comes, that parents can take to prevent what I call ¡°work-life 

unreadiness.¡±
 41  http://www.TopSage.com
You can start this process when they are 11 or 12. Periodically review their emerging 

strengths and weaknesses with them and work together on any shortcomings, like difficulty 

in communicating well or collaborating. Also, identify the kinds of interests they keep 

coming back to, as these offer clues to the careers that will fit them best.
 42  http://www.TopSage.com
Kids need a range of authentic role models ¨C as opposed to members of their clique, pop 

stars and vaunted athletes. Have regular dinner-table discussions about people the family 

knows and how they got where they are. Discuss the joys and downsides of your own career 

and encourage your kids to form some ideas about their own future. When asked what they 

want to do, they should be discouraged from saying ¡°I have no idea.¡± They can change 

their minds 200 times, but having only a foggy view of the future is of little good.

Teachers are responsible for teaching kids how to learn; parents should be responsible for 

teaching them how to work. Assign responsibilities around the house and make sure homework 

deadlines are met. Encourage teenagers to take a part-time job. Kids need plenty of 

practice delaying gratification and deploying effective organizational skills, such as 

managing time and setting priorities.
 44  http://www.TopSage.com
Playing video games encourages immediate content. And hours of watching TV shows with 

canned laughter only teaches kids to process information in a passive way. At the same 

time, listening through earphones to the same monotonous beats for long stretches 

encourages kids to stay inside their bubble instead of pursuing other endeavors. All these 

activities can prevent the growth of important communication and thinking skills and make 

it difficult for kids to develop the kind of sustained concentration they will need for

They should know how to deal with setbacks, stresses and feelings of inadequacy. They 

should also learn how to solve problems and resolve conflicts, ways to brainstorm and 

think critically. Discussions at home can help kids practice doing these things and help 

them apply these skills to everyday life situations.
What about the son or daughter who is grown but seems to be struggling and wandering 

aimlessly through early adulthood? Parents still have a major role to play, but now it is 

more delicate. They have to be careful not to come across as disappointed in their child. 

They should exhibit strong interest and respect for whatever currently interests their 

fledging adult (as naive or ill conceived as it may seem) while becoming a partner in 

exploring options for the future. Most of all, these new adults must feel that they are 

respected and supported by a family that appreciates them.

The study of law has been recognized for centuries as a basic intellectual discipline in 

European universities. However, only in recent years has it become a feature of 

undergraduate programs in Canadian universities. (46) Traditionally, legal learning has 

been viewed in such institutions as the special preserve of lawyers, rather than a 

necessary part of the intellectual equipment of an educated person. Happily, the older and 

more continental view of legal education is establishing itself in a number of Canadian 

universities and some have even begun to offer undergraduate degrees in law.
If the study of law is beginning to establish itself as part and parcel of a general 

education, its aims and methods should appeal directly to journalism educators. Law is a 

discipline which encourages responsible judgment. On the one hand, it provides 

opportunities to analyze such ideas as justice, democracy and freedom. (47) On the other, 

it links these concepts to everyday realities in a manner which is parallel to the links 

journalists forge on a daily basis as they cover and comment on the news. For example, 

notions of evidence and fact, of basic rights and public interest are at work in the 

process of journalistic judgment and production just as in courts of law. Sharpening 

judgment by absorbing and reflecting on law is a desirable component of a journalist¡¯s 

intellectual preparation for his or her career.
(48) But the idea that the journalist must understand the law more profoundly than an 

ordinary citizen rests on an understanding of the established conventions and special 

responsibilities of the news media. Politics or, more broadly, the functioning of the 

state, is a major subject for journalists. The better informed they are about the way the 

state works, the better their reporting will be. (49) In fact, it is difficult to see how 

journalists who do not have a clear grasp of the basic features of the Canadian 

Constitution can do a competent job on political stories.
Furthermore, the legal system and the events which occur within it are primary subjects 

for journalists. While the quality of legal journalism varies greatly, there is an undue 

reliance amongst many journalists on interpretations supplied to them by lawyers. (50) 

While comment and reaction from lawyers may enhance stories, it is preferable for 

journalists to rely on their own notions of significance and make their own judgments. 

These can only come from a well-grounded understanding of the legal system.

Dear Sir or Madam,
I¡¯m a student in the university and a loyal reader of this library. I¡¯m writing to tell 

some of my ideas, which I hope to be helpful for you.
I notice that many magazines in our library are out of date. It would be beneficial to us 

students if they could be updated in time. And I suggest introducing some new journals so 

as to bring new fresh air to the library. Furthermore, since we have a huge number of 

books, it is not easy to find the right one easily. However, if we can introduce some new 

searching means, such as implementing new information management system that would be 

useful.
Thank you for taking time reading this letter and I¡¯m looking forward to seeing some new 

changes soon.
Sincerely Yours,
Li Ming

As can be seen from the cartoon, different ideas may come from the same thing. In the 

picture, while trying to catch the upcoming soccer, the goal-keeper says to himself why it 

is so big. And, the striker simply thinks in a different way, that is why it is so small?
What makes such a big contrary on the same tournament at the same moment? It is no doubt 

that they are facing the very same goal and experiencing the very same moment. However, 

the subjective views result in different impression on the same object. Many of us may 

still remember the story of a pony crossing the river, which we learned from the textbook 

in primary school. The squirrel tells him, the river is deep; and the cow tells him, the 

river is not deep at all. However, in the end, he tells himself a third answer. Therefore, 

it is not exaggerating to say that most of us are looking into the world with personal 

ideas. Subjective mental status may result in a really big difference in personal views, 

just like the goal-keeper and the striker in the drawing.
A possible solution might be to face any situation as objectively as possible. If we 

realize this in an objective way, it would be good for us to deal with what we encounter 

in life, especially when we are in setbacks or facing difficulties.

The idea that some groups of people may be more intelligent than others is one of those 

hypotheses that dare not speak its name. But Gregory Cochran is  1  to say it anyway. He 

is that  2  bird, a scientist who works independently  3  any institution. He helped 

popularize the idea that some diseases not  4  thought to have a bacterial cause were 

actually infections, which aroused much controversy when it was first suggested.
 5  he, however, might tremble at the  6  of what he is about to do. Together with 

another two scientists, he is publishing a paper which not only  7  that one group of 

humanity is more intelligent than the others, but explains the process that has brought 

this about. The group in  8  are a particular people originated from central Europe. The 

process is natural selection.
This group generally do well in IQ test,  9  12-15 points above the  10  value of 100, 

and have contributed  11  to the intellectual and cultural life of the West, as the  12

  of their elites, including several world-renowned scientists,  13 . They also suffer 

more often than most people from a number of nasty genetic diseases, such as breast 

cancer. These facts,  14 , have previously been thought unrelated. The former has been 

 15  to social effects, such as a strong tradition of  16  education. The latter was 

seen as a (an)  17  of genetic isolation. Dr. Cochran suggests that the intelligence and 

diseases are intimately  18 . His argument is that the unusual history of these people 

has  19  them to unique evolutionary pressures that have resulted in this  20  state of 

affairs.

While still catching-up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way 

ahead in at least one undesirable category. ¡°Women are particularly susceptible to 

developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,¡± 

according to Dr. Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York¡¯s Veteran¡¯s Administration 

Hospital.
Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affect the stress 

response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do 

males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats 

had their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses 

became equal to those of the males.
Adding to a woman¡¯s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased ¡°opportunities

¡± for stress. ¡°It¡¯s not necessarily that women don¡¯t cope as well. It¡¯s just that they 

have so much more to cope with,¡± says Dr. Yehuda. ¡°Their capacity for tolerating stress 

may even be greater than men¡¯s,¡± she observes, ¡°it¡¯s just that they¡¯re dealing with so 

many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.¡±
Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. ¡°I think that the kinds of things 

that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to 

war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical 

violence. The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in 

domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not 

to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear that comes from these longer relationships can be 

quite devastating.¡±
Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to finish 

college. ¡°I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much 

frustration that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.¡± 

Later, her marriage ended and she became a single mother. ¡°It¡¯s the hardest thing to 

take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt. 

I lived from paycheck to paycheck.¡±
Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most 

women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. 

Alvarez¡¯s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before 

it threatens your health and your ability to function.
21.	Which of the following is true according to the first two paragraphs?
[A] Women are biologically more vulnerable to stress.
[B] Women are still suffering much stress caused by men.
[C] Women are more experienced than men in coping with stress.

[A] need extra doses of chemicals to handle stress.
[B] have limited capacity for tolerating stress.
[C] are more capable of avoiding stress.

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory 

would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then 

remove the authors¡¯ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for 

review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for 

publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers 

seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the journal.
No longer. The Internet ¨C and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why 

commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting 

access to it ¨C is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for 

Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-

reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in 

Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so 

far, made handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what 

has, until now, been a key element of scientific endeavor.
The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in 

part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core 

scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The 

International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there 

are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more 

than 1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.
This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals are now 

online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main ones were identified by the 

report¡¯s authors. There is the so-called big deal, where institutional subscribers pay 

for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing agreements. 

There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his 

employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, 

where organizations such as universities or international laboratories support 

institutional repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as 

delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first 

six months, before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this 

could change the traditional form of the peer-review process, at least for the publication 

of papers.
26.	In the first paragraph, the author discusses
[A] the background information of journal editing.
[B] the publication routine of laboratory reports.
[C] the relations of authors with journal publishers.
[D] the traditional process of journal publication.
27.	Which of the following is true of the OECD report?
[A] It criticizes government-funded research.
[B] It introduces an effective means of publication.
[C] It upsets profit-making journal publishers.
[D] It benefits scientific research considerably.
28.	According to the text, online publication is significant in that
[A] it provides an easier access to scientific results.
[B] it brings huge profits to scientific researchers.
[C] it emphasizes the crucial role of scientific knowledge.
[D] it facilitates public investment in scientific research.
29.	With the open-access publishing model, the author of a paper is required to
[A] cover the cost of its publication.
[B] subscribe to the journal publishing it.
[C] allow other online journals to use it freely.
[D] complete the peer-review before submission.
30.	Which of the following best summarizes the text?
[A] The Internet is posing a threat to publishers.
[B] A new mode of publication is emerging.
[C] Authors welcome the new channel for publication.
[D] Publication is rendered easier by online service.

In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in the National 

Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, 

however, he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have 

changed dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust 

team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.
The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have 

generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years 

ago, today¡¯s people ¨C especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for 

many generations ¨C apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren¡¯t 

likely to get any taller. ¡°In the general population today, at this genetic, 

environmental level, we¡¯ve pretty much gone as far as we can go,¡± says anthropologist 

William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of NBA players, their 

increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common practice of recruiting 

players from all over the world.
Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients ¨C 

notably, protein ¨C to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-

nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, 

children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half 

every 20 years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the 

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height ¨C 5¡ä9¡å for men, 5¡ä4¡å for 

women ¨C hasn¡¯t really changed since 1960.
Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During 

childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, 

even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to 

struggle with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by 

oversize limbs. ¡°There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture 

of the individual organism,¡± says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern 

University.
Genetic maximums can change, but don¡¯t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon, 

senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 

percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, 

unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some 

time. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a piece of 

equipment, Gordon says that by and large, ¡°you could use today¡¯s data and feel fairly 

confident.¡±
31.	Wilt Chamberlain is cited as an example to
[A] illustrate the change of height of NBA players.
[B] show the popularity of NBA players in the U.S..
[C] compare different generations of NBA players.
[D] assess the achievements of famous NBA players.
32.	Which of the following plays a key role in body growth according to the text?
[A] Genetic modification.
[B] Natural environment.
[C] Living standards.
[D] Daily exercise.
33.	On which of the following statements would the author most probably agree?
[A] Non-Americans add to the average height of the nation.
[B] Human height is conditioned by the upright posture.
[C] Americans are the tallest on average in the world.
[D] Larger babies tend to become taller in adulthood.
34.	We learn from the last paragraph that in the near future
[A] the garment industry will reconsider the uniform size.
[B] the design of military uniforms will remain unchanged.
[C] genetic testing will be employed in selecting sportsmen.
[D] the existing data of human height will still be applicable.
35.	The text intends to tell us that
[A] the change of human height follows a cyclic pattern.
[B] human height is becoming even more predictable.
[C] Americans have reached their genetic growth limit.
[D] the genetic pattern of Americans has altered.
Text 4
In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington, 

52, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw ¨C 

having extracted them from the mouths of his slaves.
That¡¯s a far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember 

from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles 

slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by 

DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had 

fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years 

have scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the 

moral compromises made by the nation¡¯s early leaders and the fragile nature of the 

country¡¯s infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew 

slavery was wrong ¨C and yet most did little to fight it.
More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of their 

time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also 

understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they 

helped to create.
For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was 

¡°like having a large bank account,¡± says Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God: George 

Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states would not have 

signed the Constitution without protections for the ¡°peculiar institution,¡± including a 

clause that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional 

representation.
And the statesmen¡¯s political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed 

Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes 

of the southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended 

slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, 

including three slave states.
Still, Jefferson freed Hemings¡¯s children ¨C though not Hemings herself or his 

approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men were 

created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary 

War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in 

his will. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in 

Virginia.
36.	George Washington¡¯s dental surgery is mentioned to
[A] show the primitive medical practice in the past.
[B] demonstrate the cruelty of slavery in his days.
[C] stress the role of slaves in the U.S. history.
[D] reveal some unknown aspect of his life.
37.	We may infer from the second paragraph that
[A] DNA technology has been widely applied to history research.
[B] in its early days the U.S. was confronted with delicate situations.
[C] historians deliberately made up some stories of Jefferson¡¯s life.
[D] political compromises are easily found throughout the U.S. history.

The time for sharpening pencils, arranging your desk, and doing almost anything else 

instead of writing has ended. The first draft will appear on the page only if you stop 

avoiding the inevitable and sit, stand up, or lie down to write. 
Be flexible. Your outline should smoothly conduct you from one point to the next, but do 

not permit it to railroad you. If a relevant and important idea occurs to you now, work it 

into the draft. Grammar, punctuation, and spelling can wait until you 

revise. Concentrate on what you are saying. Good writing most often occurs when you are in 

hot pursuit of an idea rather than in a nervous search for errors.Your pages will be easier to keep track of that way, and, if you have 

to clip a paragraph to place it elsewhere, you will not lose any writing on the other 

side.
If you are working on a word processor, you can take advantage of its capacity to make 

additions and deletions as well as move entire paragraphs by making just a few simple 

keyboard commands. Some software programs can also check spelling and certain grammatical 

elements in your writing. These printouts are also easier to read 

than the screen when you work on revisions.
Once you have a first draft on paper, you can delete material that is unrelated to your 

thesis and add material necessary to illustrate your points and make your paper 

convincing. The student who wrote ¡°The A & P as a State of Mind¡± wisely dropped a 

paragraph that questioned whether Sammy displays chauvinistic attitudes toward women. (45) 

Remember that your initial draft is only that. You should go through the paper many times 

¨C and then again ¨C working to substantiate and clarify your ideas. You may even end up 

with several entire versions of the paper. Rewrite. The sentences within each paragraph 

should be related to a single topic. Transitions should connect one paragraph to the next 

so that there are no abrupt or confusing shifts. Awkward or wordy phrasing or unclear 

sentences and paragraphs should be mercilessly poked and prodded into shape.
[A]	To make revising easier, leave wide margins and extra space between lines so that 

you can easily add words, sentences, and corrections. Write on only one side of the paper.
[B]	After you have clearly and adequately developed the body of your paper, pay 

particular attention to the introductory and concluding paragraphs. It¡¯s probably best to 

write the introduction last, after you know precisely what you are introducing. Concluding 

paragraphs demand equal attention because they leave the reader with a final impression.
[C]	It¡¯s worth remembering, however, that though a clean copy fresh off a printer may 

look terrific, it will read only as well as the thinking and writing that have gone into 

it. Many writers prudently store their data on disks and print their pages each time they 

finish a draft to avoid losing any material because of power failures or other problems.
[D]	It makes no difference how you write, just so you do. Now that you have developed 

a topic into a tentative thesis, you can assemble your notes and begin to flesh out 

whatever outline you have made.
[E]	Although this is an interesting issue, it has nothing to do with the thesis, which 

explains how the setting influences Sammy¡¯s decision to quit his job. Instead of 

including that paragraph, she added one that described Lengel¡¯s crabbed response to the 

girls so that she could lead up to the A & P ¡°policy¡± he enforces.
[F]	In the final paragraph about the significance of the setting in ¡°A & P,¡± the 

student brings together the reasons Sammy quit his job by referring to his refusal to 

accept Lengel¡¯s store policies.
[G]	By using the first draft as a means of thinking about what you want to say, you 

will very likely discover more than your notes originally suggested. Plenty of good 

writers don¡¯t use outlines at all but discover ordering principles as they write. Do not 

attempt to compose a perfectly correct draft the first time around.

In his autobiography, Darwin himself speaks of his intellectual powers with extraordinary 

modesty. He points out that he always experienced much difficulty in expressing himself 

clearly and concisely, but (46) he believes that this very difficulty may have had the 

compensating advantage of forcing him to think long and intently about every sentence, and 

thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations. He disclaimed 

the possession of any great quickness of apprehension or wit, such as distinguished 

Huxley. (47) He asserted, also, that his power to follow a long and purely abstract train 

of thought was very limited, for which reason he felt certain that he never could have 

succeeded with mathematics. His memory, too, he described as extensive, but hazy. So poor 

in one sense was it that he never could remember for more than a few days a single date or 

a line of poetry. (48) On the other hand, he did not accept as well founded the charge 

made by some of his critics that, while he was a good observer, he had no power of 

reasoning. This, he thought, could not be true, because the ¡°Origin of Species¡± is one 

long argument from the beginning to the end, and has convinced many able men. No one, he 

submits, could have written it without possessing some power of reasoning. He was willing 

to assert that ¡°I have a fair share of invention, and of common sense or judgment, such 

as every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher 

degree.¡± (49) He adds humbly that perhaps he was ¡°superior to the common run of men in 

noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully.¡±
Writing in the last year of his life, he expressed the opinion that in two or three 

respects his mind had changed during the preceding twenty or thirty years. Up to the age 

of thirty or beyond it poetry of many kinds gave him great pleasure. Formerly, too, 

pictures had given him considerable, and music very great, delight. In 1881, however, he 

said: ¡°Now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry. I have also almost 

lost my taste for pictures or music.¡± (50) Darwin was convinced that the loss of these 

tastes was not only a loss of happiness, but might possibly be injurious to the intellect, 

and more probably to the moral character.

	Text 1
Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on auto-pilot 

and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. "Not choice, but habit 

rules the unreflecting herd," William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In the ever-

changing 21st century, even the word "habit" carries a negative connotation.
So it seems antithetical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and 

innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop new 

habits, we create parallel synaptic paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can 

jump our trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks.
But don't bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are worn into 

the hippocampus, they're there to stay. Instead, the new habits we deliberately ingrain 

into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads.
"The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder," says Dawna Markova, 

author of "The Open Mind" and an executive change consultant for Professional Thinking 

Partners. "But we are taught instead to 'decide,' just as our president calls himself 'the 

Decider.' " She adds, however, that "to decide is to kill off all possibilities but one. A 

good innovational thinker is always exploring the many other possibilities."
All of us work through problems in ways of which we're unaware, she says. Researchers in 

the late 1960 covered that humans are born with the capacity to approach challenges in 

four primary ways: analytically, procedurally, relationally (or collaboratively) and 

innovatively. At puberty, however, the brain shuts down half of that capacity, preserving 

only those modes of thought that have seemed most valuable during the first decade or so 

of life.
The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, meaning 

that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of thought. "This 

breaks the major rule in the American belief system ¡ª that anyone can do anything," 

explains M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book "This Year I Will..." and Ms. Markova's 

business partner. "That's a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters commonness. 

Knowing what you're good at and doing even more of it creates excellence." This is where 

developing new habits comes in.
21.	The view of Wordsworth habit is claimed by being ________.
A. casual       B. familiar     C. mechanical    D. changeable
22.	The researchers have discovered that the formation of habit can be ________
A. predicted    B. regulated    C. traced        D. guided
23.	"ruts"(in line one, paragraph 3) has closest meaning to ________
A. tracks       B. series       C. characteristics  D. connections

It is a wise father that knows his own child, but today a man can boost his paternal 

(fatherly) wisdom ¨C or at least confirm that he's the kid's dad. All he needs to do is 

shell our $30 for paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore ¨C and another $120 

to get the results.
More than 60,000 people have purchased the PTKs since they first become available without 

prescriptions last years, according to Doug Fog, chief operating officer of Identigene, 

which makes the over-the-counter kits. More than two dozen companies sell DNA tests 

Directly to the public , ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to more than $2500.
Among the most popular : paternity and kinship testing , which adopted children can use to 

find their biological relatives and latest rage a many passionate genealogists-and 

supports businesses that offer to search for a family's geographic roots .
Most tests require collecting cells by webbing saliva in the mouth and sending it to the 

company for testing.  All tests require a potential candidate with whom to compare DNA.
But some observers are skeptical, "There is a kind of false precision being hawked by 

people claiming they are doing ancestry testing," says Trey Duster, a New York University 

sociologist. He notes that each individual has many ancestors-numbering in the hundreds 

just a few centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single lineage, 

either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father's line or mitochondrial DNA, 

which a passed down only from mothers. This DNA can reveal genetic information about only 

one or two ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back people also 

have six other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14 other great-great-

grandparents.
Critics also argue that commercial genetic testing is only as good as the reference 

collections to which a sample is compared. Databases used by some companies don't rely on 

data collected systematically but rather lump together information from different research 

projects. This means that a DNA database may differ depending on the company that 

processes the results. In addition, the computer programs a company uses to estimate 

relationships may be patented and not subject to peer review or outside evaluation.

The relationship between formal education and economic growth in poor countries is widely 

misunderstood by economists and politicians alike progress in both area is undoubtedly 

necessary for the social, political and intellectual development of these and all other 

societies; however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very highest 

priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor countries is wrong. We are 

fortunate that is it, because new educational systems there and putting enough people 

through them to improve economic performance would require two or three generations. The 

findings of a research institution have consistently shown that workers in all countries 

can be trained on the job to achieve radical higher productivity and, as a result, 

radically higher standards of living.
Ironically, the first evidence for this idea appeared in the United States. Not long ago, 

with the country entering a recessing and Japan at its pre-bubble peak. The U.S. workforce 

was derided as poorly educated and one of primary cause of the poor U.S. economic 

performance. Japan was, and remains, the global leader in automotive-assembly 

productivity. Yet the research revealed that the U.S. factories of Honda Nissan, and 

Toyota achieved about 95 percent of the productivity of their Japanese counterparts -- a 

result of the training that U.S. workers received on the job.
More recently, while examining housing construction, the researchers discovered that 

illiterate, non-English- speaking Mexican workers in Houston, Texas, consistently met 

best-practice labor productivity standards despite the complexity of the building 

industry's work.
What is the real relationship between education and economic development? We have to 

suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when 

governments don't force it. After all, that's how education got started. When our 

ancestors were hunters and gatherers 10,000 years ago, they didn't have time to wonder 

much about anything besides finding food. Only when humanity began to get its food in a 

more productive way was there time for other things.
As education improved, humanity's productivity potential, they could in turn afford more 

education. This increasingly high level of education is probably a necessary, but not a 

sufficient, condition for the complex political systems required by advanced economic 

performance. Thus poor countries might not be able to escape their poverty traps without 

political changes that may be possible only with broader formal education. A lack of 

formal education, however, doesn't constrain the ability of the developing world's 

workforce to substantially improve productivity for the forested future. On the contrary, 

constraints on improving productivity explain why education isn't developing more quickly 

there than it is.
31.	The author holds in paragraph 1 that the important of education in poor countries  

___________.
[A] is subject groundless doubts
[B] has fallen victim of bias
[C] is conventional downgraded
[D] has been overestimated
32.	It is stated in paragraph 1 that construction of a new education system  

__________.
[A] challenges economists and politicians
[B] takes efforts of generations
[C] demands priority from the government
[D] requires sufficient labor force
33.	A major difference between the Japanese and U.S workforces is that __________.
[A] the Japanese workforce is better disciplined
[B] the Japanese workforce is more productive
[C] the U.S workforce has a better education
[D] the U.S workforce is more organize
34.	The author quotes the example of our ancestors to show that education emerged 

__________.
[A] when people had enough time
[B] prior to better ways of finding food
[C] when people on longer went hung
[D] as a result of pressure on government
35.	According to the last paragraph , development of education __________.
[A] results directly from competitive environments
[B] does not depend on economic performance
[C] follows improved productivity
[D] cannot afford political changes
	Text 4
The most thoroughly studied in the history of the new world are the ministers and 

political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the standard history of 

American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was "So much important attached to 

intellectual pursuits " According to many books and articles, New England's leaders 

established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, dominant Puritan 

tradition in American intellectual life.
To take this approach to the New Englanders normally mean to start with the Puritans' 

theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church-important subjects 

that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual 

life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture adjusting to 

New world circumstances. The New England colonies were the scenes of important episodes in 

the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility and virtuosity.
The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education and influence 

in England. `Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to Massachusetts church 

in the decade after 1629,There were political leaders like John Winthrop, an educated 

gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he journeyed to Boston. There men 

wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and 

giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness.
We should not forget , however, that most New Englanders were less well educated. While 

few crafts men or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left literary compositions 

to be analyzed, The in thinking often had a traditional superstitions quality. A tailor 

named John Dane, who emigrated in the late 1630s, left an account of his reasons for 

leaving England that is filled with signs. sexual confusion, economic frustrations , and 

religious hope-all name together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, told his 

father the first line he saw would settle his fate, and read the magical words: "come out 

from among them, touch no unclean thing , and I will be your God and you shall be my 

people." One wonders what Dane thought of the careful sermons explaining the Bible that he 

heard in puritan churched.
Meanwhile, many settles had slighter religious commitments than Dane's, as one clergyman 

learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had not come to the New 

world for religion . "Our main end was to catch fish. "
36.	The author notes that in the seventeenth-century New England___________.
[A] Puritan tradition dominated political life.
[B] intellectual interests were encouraged.
[C] Politics benefited much from intellectual endeavors.
[D] intellectual pursuits enjoyed a liberal environment.
37.	It is suggested in paragraph 2 that New Englanders__________.
[A] experienced a comparatively peaceful early history.
[B] brought with them the culture of the Old World
[C] paid little attention to southern intellectual life
[D] were obsessed with religious innovations
38.	The early ministers and political leaders in Massachusetts Bay__________.

[B] gained increasing importance in religious affairs
[C] abandoned high positions before coming to the New World
[D] created a new intellectual atmosphere in New England

__________.
[A] influenced by superstitions
[B] troubled with religious beliefs
[C] puzzled by church sermons
[D] frustrated with family earnings

Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by British 

naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s, British social philosopher Herbert Spencer put 

forward his own theory of biological and cultural evolution. Spencer argued that all 

worldly phenomena, including human societies, changed over time, advancing toward 

perfection. 41.____________.
American social scientist Lewis Henry Morgan introduced another theory of cultural 

evolution in the late 1800s. Morgan, along with Tylor, was one of the founders of modern 

anthropology. In his work, he attempted to show how all aspects of culture changed 

together in the evolution of societies.42._____________.
In the early 1900s in North America, German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas 

developed a new theory of culture known as historical particularism. Historical 

particularism, which emphasized the uniqueness of all cultures, gave new direction to 

anthropology. 43._____________.
Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the result of a unique 

history and not as one of many cultures belonging to a broader evolutionary stage or type 

of culture. 44._______________.
Historical particularism became a dominant approach to the study of culture in American 

anthropology, largely through the influence of many students of Boas. But a number of 

anthropologists in the early 1900s also rejected the particularist theory of culture in 

favor of diffusionism. Some attributed virtually every important cultural achievement to 

the inventions of a few, especially gifted peoples that, according to diffusionists, then 

spread to other cultures. 45.________________.
Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist ¨¦mile Durkheim developed a theory of culture 

that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim proposed that religious beliefs 

functioned to reinforce social solidarity. An interest in the relationship between the 

function of society and culture¡ªknown as functionalism¡ªbecame a major theme in European, 

and especially British, anthropology.
[A]	Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such as inventions, had 

a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as diffusionism.
[B]	In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, Boas became 

skilled in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of 

human biology and anatomy.
[C]	He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle he called the 

"survival of the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually be replaced 

by stronger, more advanced races and societies.
[D]	They also focused on important rituals that appeared to preserve a people's social 

structure, such as initiation ceremonies that formally signify children's entrance into 

adulthood.
[E]	Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, 

forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of government, 

technology, and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved.
[F]	Supporters of the theory viewed as a collection of integrated parts that work 

together to keep a society functioning.
[G]	For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry 

incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, pottery 

making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world. 

In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred separately at different times in many 

parts of the world.

There is a marked difference between the education which everyone gets from living with 

others, and the deliberate educating of the young. In the former case the education is 

incidental; it is natural and important, but it is not the express reason of the 

association. (46) It may be said that the measure of the worth of any social institution 

is its effect in enlarging and improving experience; but this effect is not a part of its 

original motive. Religious associations began, for example, in the desire to secure the 

favor of overruling powers and to ward off evil influences; family life in the desire to 

gratify appetites and secure family perpetuity; systematic labor, for the most part, 

because of enslavement to others, etc. (47) Only gradually was the by-product of the 

institution noted, and only more gradually still was this effect considered as a directive 

factor in the conduct of the institution. Even today, in our industrial life, apart from 

certain values of industriousness and thrift, the intellectual and emotional reaction of 

the forms of human association under which the world's work is carried on receives little 

attention as compared with physical output.
But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an immediate human fact, 

gains in importance. (48) While it is easy to ignore in our contact with them the effect 

of our acts upon their disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults. The need 

of training is too evident; the pressure to accomplish a change in their attitude and 

habits is too urgent to leave these consequences wholly out of account. (49) Since our 

chief business with them is to enable them to share in a common life we cannot help 

considering whether or no we are forming the powers which will secure this ability. If 

humanity has made some headway in realizing that the ultimate value of every institution 

is its distinctively human effect we may well believe that this lesson has been learned 

largely through dealings with the young.
(50) We are thus led to distinguish, within the broad educational process which we have 

been so far considering, a more formal kind of education -- that of direct tuition or 

schooling. In undeveloped social groups, we find very little formal teaching and training. 

These groups mainly rely for instilling needed dispositions into the young upon the same 

sort of association which keeps the adults loyal to their group.

Vividly depicted in the cartoon is a race of humans on a social network that are isolated 

in their own little cubicles. They are all sitting in front of their computers, connected 

to each other through the Internet and their devoted looks and postures showed their 

addiction to the Internet.
This cartoon, I believe, intends to draw our attentions to the negative effects the 

Internet has brought to our daily life as it brings in some benefits, such as easy access 

to information, instant communication with people from afar and cheap cost of 

communication. The more people are hooked to the Net, the more isolated they are from the 

real world. Since people can easily pretend their identities on the Internet, everything 

online becomes illusive and untrustworthy. The Internet, which was intended to bring 

people closer to each other, in effect prevents people from making real acquaintances that 

one can make with a casual exchange of greetings and eye-contact in a face-to-face 

communication.
Serious consequences, such as fear of real-time interactions, online cheating or

¡¡¡¡Text 1
¡¡¡¡First two hours, now three hours ¡ª this is how far in advance authorities are 

recommending people show up to catch a domestic flight, at least at some major U.S. 

airports with increasingly massive security lines.
¡¡¡¡Americans are willing to tolerate time-consuming security protocols in return for 

increased safety. The crash of Egypt Air Flight 804, which terrorists may have downed over 

the Mediterranean Sea, provides another tragic reminder of why. But demanding too much of 

air travelers or providing too little security in return undermines public support for the 

process. And it should: Wasted time is a drag on Americans' economic and private lives, 

not to mention infuriating.
¡¡¡¡Last year, the Transportation Security Administration(TSA) found in a secret check that 

undercover investigators were able to sneak weapons ¡ª both fake and real ¡ª past airport 

security nearly every time they tried. Enhanced security measures since then, combined 

with a rise in airline travel due to the improving economy and low oil prices, have 

resulted in long waits at major airports such as Chicago's O'Hare International. It is not 

yet clear how much more effective airline security has become ¡ª but the lines are 

obvious.
¡¡¡¡Part of the issue is that the government did not anticipate the steep increase in 

airline travel, so the TSA is now rushing to get new screeners on the line. Part of the 

issue is that airports have only so much room for screening lanes. Another factor may be 

that more people are trying to overpack their carry-on bags to avoid checked-baggage fees, 

though the airlines strongly dispute this.
¡¡¡¡There is one step the TSA could take that would not require remodeling airports or 

rushing to hire: Enroll more people in the PreCheck program. PreCheck is supposed to be a 

win-win for travelers and the TSA. Passengers who pass a background check are eligible to 

use expedited screening lanes. This allows the TSA to focus on travelers who are higher 

risk, saving time for everyone involved. TSA wants to enroll 25 million people in 

PreCheck.

¡¡¡¡It has not gotten anywhere close to that, and one big reason is sticker shock: 

Passengers must pay $85 every five years to process their background checks. Since the 

beginning, this price tag has been PreCheck's fatal flaw. Upcoming reforms might bring the 

price to a more reasonable level. But Congress should look into doing so directly, by 

helping to finance PreCheck enrollment or to cut costs in other ways.
¡¡¡¡The TSA cannot continue diverting resources into underused PreCheck lanes while most of 

the traveling public suffers in unnecessary lines. It is long past time to make the 

program work.

¡¡¡¡21. The crash of Egypt Air Flight 804 is mentioned to____
¡¡¡¡[A] explain American¡¯s tolerance of current security checks.
¡¡¡¡[B] stress the urgency to strengthen security worldwide.
¡¡¡¡[C] highlight the necessity of upgrading major U.S. airports.

¡¡¡¡Text 2
¡¡¡¡¡°The ancient Hawaiians were astronomers,¡± wrote Queen Liliuokalani, Hawaii's last 

reigning monarch, in 1897. Star watchers were among the most esteemed members of Hawaiian 

society. Sadly, all is not well with astronomy in Hawaii today. Protests have erupted over 

construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), a giant observatory that promises to 

revolutionize humanity's view of the cosmos.
¡¡¡¡At issue is the TMT's planned location on Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano worshiped by 

some Hawaiians as the piko, that connects the Hawaiian Islands to the heavens. But Mauna 

Kea is also home to some of the world's most powerful telescopes. Rested in the Pacific 

Ocean, Mauna Kea's peak rises above the bulk of our planet's dense atmosphere, where 

conditions allow telescopes to obtain images of unsurpassed clarity.
¡¡¡¡Opposition to telescopes on Mauna Kea is nothing new. A small but vocal group of 

Hawaiians and environmentalists have long viewed their presence as disrespect far sacred 

land and a painful reminder of the occupation of what was once a sovereign nation.
¡¡¡¡Some blame for the current controversy belongs to astronomers. In their eagerness to 

build bigger telescopes, they forgot that science is not the only way of understanding the 

world. They did not always prioritize the protection of Mauna Kea's fragile ecosystems or 

its holiness to the islands' inhabitants. Hawaiian culture is not a relic of the past£» it 

is a living culture undergoing a renaissance today.
¡¡¡¡Yet science has a cultural history, too, with roots going back to the dawn of 

civilization. The same curiosity to find what lies beyond the horizon that first brought 

early Polynesians to Hawaii's shores inspires astronomers today to explore the heavens. 

Calls to disassemble all telescopes on Mauna Kea or to ban future development there ignore 

the reality that astronomy and Hawaiian culture both seek to answer big questions about 

who we are, where we come from and where we are going. Perhaps that is why we explore the 

starry skies, as if answering a primal calling to know ourselves and our true ancestral 

homes.
¡¡¡¡The astronomy community is making compromises to change its use of Mauna Kea. The TMT 

site was chosen to minimize the telescope¡¯s visibility around the island and to avoid 

archaeological and environmental impact. To limit the number of telescopes on Mauna Kea, 

old ones will be removed at the end of their lifetimes and their sites returned to a 

natural state. There is no reason why everyone cannot be welcomed on Mauna Kea to embrace 

their cultural heritage and to study the stars.

¡¡¡¡26. Queen Liliuokalani¡¯s remark in Paragraph 1 indicates____
¡¡¡¡[A] her conservative view on the historical role of astronomy.
¡¡¡¡[B] the importance of astronomy in ancient Hawaiian society.
¡¡¡¡[C]the regrettable decline of astronomy in ancient times.
¡¡¡¡[D] her appreciation of star watchers¡¯ feats in her time.
¡¡¡¡
  ¡¡27. Mauna Kea is deemed as an ideal astronomical site due to____
  ¡¡[A] its geographical features.
¡¡¡¡[B] its protective surroundings.
  ¡¡[C] its religious implications.
    [D] its existing infrastructure.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡28. The construction of the TMT is opposed by some locals partly because____
¡¡¡¡[A] it may risk ruining their intellectual life.
¡¡¡¡[B] it reminds them of a humiliating history.
¡¡¡¡[C] their culture will lose a chance of revival.
¡¡¡¡[D] they fear losing control of Mauna Kea.

¡¡¡¡Robert F. Kennedy once said that a country¡¯s GDP measures ¡°everything except that 

which makes life worthwhile.¡± With Britain voting to leave the European Union, and GDP 

already predicted to slow as a result, it is now a timely moment to assess what he was 

referring to.
¡¡¡¡The question of GDP and its usefulness has annoyed policymakers for over half a 

century. Many argue that it is a flawed concept. It measures things that do not matter and 

miss things that do. By most recent measures, the UK¡¯s GDP has been the envy of the 

Western World, with record low unemployment and high growth figures. If everything was 

going so so well, then why did over 17million people vote for Brexit, despite the warnings 

about what it could do to their country¡¯s economic prospects?
¡¡¡¡A recent annual study of countries and their ability to convert growth into well-being 

sheds some light on that question. Across the 163 countries measured, the UK is one of the 

poorest performers in ensuring that economic growth is translated into meaningful 

improvement for its citizens. Rather than just focusing on GDR over 40 different sets of 

criteria from health, education and civil society engagement have been measured to get a 

more rounded  assessment of how countries are performing.
¡¡¡¡While all of these countries face their own challenges, there are a number of 

consistent themes. Yes, there has been a budding economic recovery since the 2008 global 

crash, but in key indicators in areas such as health and education, major economies have 

continued to decline. Yet this isn't the case with all countries. Some relatively poor 

European countries have seen huge improvements across measures including civil society; 

income equality and the environment.
¡¡¡¡This is a lesson that rich countries can learn: When GDP is no longer regarded as the 

sole measure of a country¡¯s success, the world looks very different.
¡¡¡¡So what Kennedy was referring to was that while GDP has been the most common method for 

measuring the economic activity of nations, as a measure, it is no longer enough. It does 

not include important factors such as environmental equality or education outcomes - all 

things that contribute to a person's sense of well-being.
¡¡¡¡The sharp hit to growth predicted around the world and in the UK could lead to a 

decline in the everyday services we depend on for our well-being and for growth. But 

policymaker who refocus efforts on improving well-being rather than simply worrying about 

GDP figures could avoid the forecasted doom and may even see progress.
¡¡¡¡31. Robert F. Kennedy is cited because he_____
¡¡¡¡[A]praised the UK for its GDP.
¡¡¡¡[B]identified GDP with happiness.
¡¡¡¡[C]misinterpreted the role of GDP.
¡¡¡¡[D]had a low opinion of GDP.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡32. It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that____
¡¡¡¡[A]the UK is reluctant to remold its economic pattern.
¡¡¡¡[B]the UK will contribute less to the world economy.
¡¡¡¡[C]GDP as the measure of success is widely defied in the UK.
¡¡¡¡[D]policymakers in the UK are paying less attention to GDP.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡33. Which of the following is true about the recent annual study?
¡¡¡¡[A]It excludes GDP as an indicator.
¡¡¡¡[B]It is sponsored by 163 countries.
¡¡¡¡[C]Its criteria are questionable.
¡¡¡¡[D]Its results are enlightening.

¡¡¡¡34. In the last two paragraphs, the author suggests that____
¡¡¡¡[A]the UK is preparing for an economic boom.
¡¡¡¡[B]high GDP foreshadows an economic decline.
¡¡¡¡[C]it is essential to consider factors beyond GDP.
¡¡¡¡[D]it requires caution to handle economic issues.

¡¡¡¡35. Which of the following is the best??for the text?

¡¡¡¡In a rare unanimous ruling, the US Supreme Court has overturned the corruption 

conviction of a former Virginia governor, Robert McDonnell. But it did so while holding 

its nose at the ethics of his conduct, which included accepting gifts such as a Rolex 

watch and a Ferrari Automobile from a company seeking access to government.
¡¡¡¡The high court¡¯s decision said the judge in Mr. McDonnell¡¯s trail failed to tell a 

jury that it must look only at his ¡°official acts,¡± or the former governor¡¯s decisions 

on ¡°specific¡± and ¡°unsettled¡± issues related to his duties.
¡¡¡¡Merely helping a gift-giver gain access to other officials, unless done with clear 

intent to pressure those officials, is not corruption, the justices found.
¡¡¡¡The court did suggest that accepting favors in return for opening doors is 

¡°distasteful¡± and ¡°nasty.¡± But under anti-bribery laws, proof must be made of concrete 

benefits, such as approval of a contract or regulation. Simply arranging a meeting, making 

a phone call, or hosting an event is not an ¡°official act.¡±
¡¡¡¡The court¡¯s ruling is legally sound in defining a kind of favoritism that is not 

criminal. Elected leaders must be allowed to help supporters deal with bureaucratic 

problems without fear of prosecution of bribery. ¡°The basic compact underlying 

representative government,¡± wrote Chief Justice John Roberts for the court, ¡°assumes 

that public officials will hear from their constituents and act on their concerns.¡±
¡¡¡¡But the ruling reinforces the need for citizens and their elected representatives, not 

the courts, to ensure equality of access to government. Officials must not be allowed to 

play favorites in providing information or in arranging meetings simply because an 

individual or group provides a campaign donation or a personal gift. This type of 

integrity requires will-enforced laws in government transparency, such as records of 

official meetings, rules on lobbying, and information about each elected leader¡¯s source 

of wealth.
¡¡¡¡Favoritism in official access can fan public perceptions of corruption. But it is not 

always corruption. Rather officials must avoid double standards, or different types of 

access for average people and the wealthy. If connections can be bought, a basic premise 

of democratic society ¨C that all are equal in treatment by government- is undermined. 

Good government rests on an understanding of the inherent worth of each individual.
¡¡¡¡The court¡¯s ruling is a step forward in the struggle against both corruption and 

official favoritism.
¡¡¡¡36. The underlined sentence(Para.1) most probably shows that the court____
¡¡¡¡[A] avoided defining the extent of McDonnell¡¯s duties.
¡¡¡¡[B] made no compromise in convicting McDonnell.
¡¡¡¡[C] was contemptuous of McDonnell¡¯s conduct.
¡¡¡¡[D] refused to comment on McDonnell¡¯s ethics.
¡¡¡¡
¡¡¡¡37. According to Paragraph 4, an official act is deemed corruptive only if it 

involves____
    [A] concrete returns for gift-givers.
¡¡¡¡[B] sizable gains in the form of gifts.
¡¡¡¡[C] leaking secrets intentionally.
¡¡¡¡[D] breaking contracts officially.

¡¡¡¡38. The court¡¯s ruling is d on the assumption that public officials are__
¡¡¡¡[A] allowed to focus on the concerns of their supporters.
¡¡¡¡[B] qualified to deal independently with bureaucratic issues.
¡¡¡¡[C] justified in addressing the needs of their constituents.
¡¡¡¡[D] exempt from conviction on the charge of favoritism.

¡¡¡¡39. Well-enforced laws in government transparency are needed to___
¡¡¡¡[A] awaken the conscience of officials.
¡¡¡¡[B] guarantee fair play in official access.
¡¡¡¡[C] allow for certain kinds of lobbying.
¡¡¡¡[D] inspire hopes in average people.

¡¡¡¡[A]The first published sketch, "A Dinner at Poplar Walk" brought tears to Dickens's 

eyes when he discovered it in the pages of The Monthly Magazine. From then on his sketches 

,which appeared under the pen name "Boz" in The Evening Chronicle, earned him a modest 

reputation.
¡¡¡¡[B]The runaway success of The Pickwick Papers, as it is generally known today, secured 

Dickens's fame. There were Pickwick coats and Pickwick cigars, and the plump, spectacled 

hero, Samuel Pickwick, became a national figure.
¡¡¡¡[C]Soon after Sketches by Boz appeared, a publishing firm approached Dickens to write a 

story in monthly installments, as a backdrop for a series of woodcuts by the ten-famous 

artist Robert Seymour, who had originated the idea for the story. With characteristic 

confidence, Dickens successfully insisted that Seymour's pictures illustrate his own story 

instead. After the first installment, Dickens wrote to the artist and asked him to correct 

a drawing Dickens felt was not faithful enough to his prose. Seymour made the change, went 

into his backyard, and expressed his displeasure by committing suicide. Dickens and his 

publishers simply pressed on with a new artist. The comic novel, The Posthumous Papers of 

the Pickwick Club, appeared serially in 1836 and 1837, and was first published in book 

form in 1837.
¡¡¡¡[D]Charles Dickens is probably the best-known and, to many people, the greatest English 

novelist of the 19th century. A moralist, satirist, and social reformer. Dickens crafted 

complex plots and striking characters that capture the panorama of English society.
¡¡¡¡[E]Soon after his father's release from prison, Dickens got a better job as errand boy 

in law offices. He taught himself shorthand to get an even better job later as a court 

stenographer and as a reporter in Parliament. At the same time, Dickens, who had a 

reporter's eye for transcribing the life around him especially anything comic or odd, 

submitted short sketches to obscure magazines.
¡¡¡¡[F] Dickens was born in Portsmouth, on England's southern coast. His father was a clerk 

in the British navy pay office -a respectable position, but wish little social status. His 

paternal grandparents, a steward and a housekeeper possessed even less status, having been 

servants, and Dickens later concealed their background. Dicken's mother supposedly came 

from a more respectable family. Yet two years before Dicken's birth, his mother's father 

was caught stealing and fled to Europe, never to return. The family's increasing poverty 

forced Dickens out of school at age 12 to work in Warren's Blacking Warehouse, a shoe-

polish factory, where the other working boys mocked him as "the young gentleman." His 

father was then imprisoned for debt. The humiliations of his father's imprisonment and his 

labor in the blacking factory formed Dicken's greatest wound and became his deepest 

secret. He could not confide them even to his wife, although they provide the 

unacknowledged foundation of his fiction.
¡¡¡¡[G] After Pickwick, Dickens plunged into a bleaker world. In Oliver Twist, e traces an 

orphan's progress from the workhouse to the criminal slums of London. Nicholas Nickleby, 

his next novel, combines the darkness of Oliver Twist with the sunlight of Pickwick. The 

popularity of these novels consolidated Dichens' as a nationally and internationally 

celebrated man of letters.

¡¡¡¡The growth of the use of English as the world`s primary language for international 

communication has obviously been continuing for several decades.
¡¡¡¡(46)But even as the number of English speakers expands further there are signs that the 

global predominance of the language may fade within the foreseeable future.
¡¡¡¡Complex international, economic, technological and culture change could start to 

diminish the leading position of English as the language of the world market, and UK 

interests which enjoy advantage from the breath of English usage would consequently face 

new pressures. Those realistic possibilities are highlighted in the study presented by 

David Graddol
¡¡¡¡(47)His analysis should therefore end any self-contentedness among those who may 

believe that the global position of English is so stable that the young generation of the 

United Kingdom do not need additional language capabilities.
¡¡¡¡David Graddol concludes that monoglot English graduates face a bleak economic future as 

qualified multilingual youngsters from other countries are proving to have a competitive 

advantage over their British counterparts in global companies and organizations. Alongside 

that,(48)many countries are introducing English into the primary-school curriculum but 

British schoolchildren and students do not appear to be gaining greater encouragement to 

achieve fluency in other languages.
¡¡¡¡If left to themselves, such trends will diminish the relative strength of the English 

language in international education markets as the demand for educational resources in 

languages, such as Spanish ,Arabic or Mandarin grows and international business process 

outsourcing in other language such as Japanese, French and German, spreads.
¡¡¡¡(49)The changes identified by David Graddol all present clear and major challenges to 

UK`s providers of English language teaching to people of other countries and to broader 

education business sectors. The English language teaching sector directly earns nearly 

&1.3 billion for the UK in invisible exports and our other education related explores earn 

up to &10 billion a year more. As the international education market expands, the recent 

slowdown in the number of international students studying in the main English-speaking 

countries is likely to continue, especially if there are no effective strategic policies 

to prevent such slippage.

¡¡Text 1
France, which prides itself as the global innovator of fashion, has decided its fashion 

industry has lost an absolute right to define physical beauty for women. Its lawmakers 

gave preliminary approval last week to a law that would make it a crime to employ ultra-

thin models on runaways. The parliament also agreed to ban websites that ¡°incite 

excessive thinness¡± by promoting extreme dieting. 
Such measures have a couple of uplifting motives. They suggest beauty should not be 

defined by looks that end up impinging on health. That¡¯s a start. And the ban on ultra-

thin models seems to go beyond protecting models from starving themselves to death-as some 

have done. It tells the fashion industry that it must take responsibility for the signal 

it sends women, especially teenage girls, about the social tape-measure they must use to 

determine their individual worth.
The bans, if fully enforced,would suggest to women (and many men) that they should not let 

others be arbiters of their beauty. And perhaps faintly,they hint that people should look 

to intangible qualities like character and intellect rather than dieting their way to size 

zero or wasp-waist physiques. 
The French measures, however, rely too much on severe punishment to change a culture that 

still regards beauty as skin-deep-and bone-showing. Under the law, using a fashion model 

that does not meet a government-defined index of body mass could result in a $85,000 fine 

and six months in prison.
The fashion industry knows it has an inherent problem in focusing on material adornment 

and idealized body types. In Denmark, the United States, and a few other countries, it is 

trying to set voluntary standards for models and fashion images that rely more on peer 

pressure for enforcement.
In contrast to France¡¯s actions, Denmark¡¯s fashion industry agreed last month on rules 

and sanctions regarding the age, health, and other characteristics of models. The newly 

revised Danish Fashion Ethical Charter clearly states: ¡°We are aware of and take 

responsibility for the impact the fashion industry has on body ideals, especially on young 

people.¡± The charter¡¯s main tool of enforcement is to deny access for designers and 

modeling agencies to Copenhagen Fashion Week (CFW), which is run by the Danish Fashion 

Institute. But in general it relies on a name-and-shame method of compliance. 
Relying on ethical persuasion rather than law to address the misuse of body ideals may be 

the best step. Even better would be to help elevate notions of beauty beyond the material 

standards of a particular industry. 
21. According to the first paragraph, what would happen in France?
 [A]New runways would be constructed.
 [B]Physical beauty would be redefined. 
[C]Websites about dieting would thrive.
 [D]The fashion industry would decline. 
22. The phrase ¡°impinging on¡± (Line2, Para.2) is closest in meaning to.
[A]heightening the value of. 
[B]indicating the state of. 
[C]losing faith in. 
[D]doing harm to.
23. Which of the following is true of the fashion industry?
[A]New standards are being set in Denmark. 
[B]The French measures have already failed. 
[C]Models are no longer under peer pressure. 
[D]Its inherent problems are getting worse.  
24. A designer is most likely to be rejected by CFW for .
[A]pursuing perfect physical conditions. 
[B]caring too much about models¡¯ character. 
[C]showing little concern for health factors. 
[D]setting a high age threshold for models.

  For the first time in history more people live in towns than in the country. In Britain 

this has had a curious result. While polls show Britons rate ¡°the countryside¡± alongside 

the royal family, Shakespeare and the National Health Service (NHS) as what makes them 

proudest of their country, this has limited political support. 
  A century ago Octavia Hill launched the National Trust not to rescue stylish houses but 

to save ¡°the beauty of natural places for everyone forever.¡± It was specifically to 

provide city dwellers with spaces for leisure where they could experience ¡°a refreshing 

air.¡± Hill¡¯s pressures later led to the creation of national parks and green belts. They 

don¡¯t make countryside any more, and every year concrete consumes more of it. It needs 

constant guardianship. 
At the next election none of the big parties seem likely to endorse this sentiment. The 

Conservatives¡¯ planning reform explicitly gives rural development priority over 

conservation, even authorizing¡°off-plan¡± building where local people might object. The 

concept of sustainable development has been defined as profitable. Labour likewise wants 

to discontinue local planning where councils oppose development. The Liberal Democrats are 

silent. Only Ukip, sensing its chance, has sided with those pleading for a more considered 

approach to using green land. Its Campaign to Protect Rural England struck terror into 

many local Conservative parties. 
The sensible place to build new houses, factories and offices is where people are, in 

cities and towns where infrastructure is in place. The London agents StirlingAckroyd 

recently identified enough sites for half a million houses in the London area alone, with 

no intrusion on green belt. What is true of London is even truer of the provinces. 
  The idea that ¡°housing crisis¡± equals ¡°concreted meadows¡± is pure lobby talk. The 

issue is not the need for more houses but, as always, where to put them. Under lobby 

pressure, George Osborne favours rural new-build against urban renovation and renewal. He 

favours out-of-town shopping sites against high streets. This is not a free market but a 

biased one. Rural towns and villages have grown and will always grow. They do so best 

where building sticks to their edges and respects their character. We do not ruin urban 

conservation areas. Why ruin rural ones? 
  Development should be planned, not let rip. After the Netherlands, Britain is Europe¡¯s 

most crowded country. Half a century of town and country planning has enabled it to retain 

an enviable rural coherence, while still permitting low-density urban living. There is no 

doubt of the alternative¡ªthe corrupted landscapes of southern Portugal, Spain or Ireland. 

Avoiding this rather than promoting it should unite the left and right of the political 

spectrum. 
26. Britain¡¯s public sentiment about the countryside.
[A]didn¡¯tstart till the Shakespearean age. 
[B]has brought much benefit to the NHS. 
[C]is fully backed by the royal family. 
[D]is not well reflected in politics.  
27. According to Paragraph 2, the achievements of the National Trust are now being____ .
[A]gradually destroyed.

[C]largely overshadowed. 
[D]properly protected.
28. Which of the following can be inferred from Paragraph 3? 
[A]Labour is under attack for opposing development.
[B]The Conservatives may abandon ¡°off-plan¡± building. 
[C]The Liberal Democrats are losing political influence.
[D]Ukip may gain from its support for rural conservation.  
29. The author holds that George Osborne¡¯s preference____ .
[A]highlights his firm stand against lobby pressure. 
[B]shows his disregard for the character of rural areas. 
[C]stresses the necessity of easing the housing crisis.

¡°There is one and only one social responsibility of business,¡± wrote Milton Friedman,a 

Nobel prize-winning economist ¡°That is, to use its resources and engage in activities 

designed to increase its profits.¡± But even if you accept Fiedman¡¯s premise and regard 

corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies as a waste of shareholders money,things may 

not be absolutely clear-cut.New research suggests that CSR may create monetary value for 

companies ¨Cat least when they are prosecuted for corruption. 
The largest firms is America and Britain together spend more than $15 billion a year on 

CSR , according to an estimate by EPG,a consulting firm ,This could add value to their 

businesses in three ways.First, consumers may take CSR spending as a ¡°signal¡± that a 

company¡¯s products are of high quality.Second, customers may be willing to buy a company

¡¯s products as an indirect way to donate to the good causes is helps. And third, through 

a more diffuse ¡°halo effect,¡± whereby its good deeds earn it greater consideration from 

consumers and others. 
Previous studies on CSR have had trouble differentiating these effects because consumers 

can be affected by all three. A recent study attempts to separate them by looking at 

bribery prosecutions under America¡¯s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). It argues that 

since prosecutors do not consume a company's products as part of their investigations, 

they could be influenced only by the halo effect. 
The study found that, among prosecuted firms, those with the most comprehensiveCSR 

programmes tendedto getmore lenient penalties. Their analysis ruled out the possibility 

that it was firms' political influence, rather than their CSR stand,that accounted for the 

leniency: Companies that contributed more to political campaigns did not receive lower 

fines.
In all, the study concludes that whereas prosecutors should only evaluate a case based on 

its merits, they do seen to influenced by a company¡¯s record in CSR. "We estimate that 

either eliminating a substantial labour-rights concern, such as child labour, or 

increasing corporate giving by about 20% results in fines that generally are 40% lower 

than the typical punishment for bribing foreign officials," says one researcher. 
Researchers admit that their study does not answer the question of how much businesses 

ought to spend on CSR. Nor does it reveal how much companies are banking on the halo 

effect, rather than the other possible benefits, when they decide their do-gooding 

policies. But at least have demonstrated that whencompanies get into trouble with the law, 

evidence of good character can winIn all, the study concludes that whereas prosecutors

     There will eventually come a day when The New York Times cases to publish stories on 

newsprint .Exactly when that day will be is a matter of debate. ¡°Sometime in the future 

¡°the paper¡¯s publisher said back in 2010. 
     Nostalgia for ink on paper and the rustle of pages aside ,there¡¯s plenty of 

incentive to ditch print .The infrastructure required to make a physical newspapers -

printing presses .delivery truck -isn¡¯t just expensive it¡¯s excessive at a time when 

online-only competition don¡¯t have the same set financial constraints . Readers are 

migrating away from print away,And although print ad sales still dwarf their online and 

mobile counterparts revenue from print is still declining. 
     Overhead may be high and circulation lowe ,but rushing to eliminate its print editor 

would be a mistake ,says BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti. 
  Peretti says the Times shouldn't waste time getting of the print business, only if they 

go about doing it the right away ¡°Figuring out a way to accelerate that transition would 

make sense for them ¡°he said, ¡°but if you discontinue it, you're going to have your most 

loyal customers really upset with you." Sometimes that's worth making a change anyway". 

Peretti gives example of Netflix discontinuing its DVD-mailing service to focus on 

streaming. "It was seen as a blunder." he said. The move turned out to be foresighted. And 

if Peretti were in charge at the times? "l wouldn't pick year to end print."he said. ¡°I 

would raise and make it into more of a legacy product.¡±
The most loyal costumer would still gel the product they favor. the idea goes, and they¡¯d 

feel like they were helping sustain the quality of something they believe in. "So if 

you're overpaying for print, you could feel like you were helping," peretti said. "Then 

increase it at rate each year and essentially try to generate additional revenue." In 

other words, if you're going to print product, make it for the people who are already 

obsessed with it. Which may be what the Times is doing already. Getting the print edition 

seven days a week costs nearly $500 a year ¡ª more than twice as much as a digital-only 

subscription.   
"It's a really hard thing to do and it's a tremendous luxury that BuzzFeed doesn't have a 

legacy business," Peretti remarked. "But we're going to have questions like that where we 

have things we're doing that don't make sense when the market.Change and the world 

changes. In those situations, it's better to be more aggressive than less aggressive."

[C]the complaints form its readers 
[D]the increasing online ad asles.

[A]seek new sources of readership. 
[B]end the print edition for goog.

  So how do we navigate this?How do we know when to invest in anupgrade?And what¡¯s the 

best way to pull off  one  that enhances our goals£¿Here are some  tips: 
41.	

As an executive coach, I¡¯ve  seen  image   upgrades   be   particularlyhelpfulduring  

transitions¡ªwhen looking  for a new  job ,  stepping  into  a  new  or  morepublic role 

,or changing  work  environments. If you¡¯re in a period of change or just feeling stuck 

and in a rut, now may be a good time. If you¡¯re not sure, ask forhonest feedback  from 

trusted friends, colleagues and professionals .Look for cues 
about how others perceive you. Maybe there¡¯s no need for an upgrade and that¡¯s OK. 
42.	

Get clear on what impact you¡¯re hoping to have. Are you looking to refresh your image or 

pivot it? For one person, the goal may be to be taken more seriously and enhance their 

professional image. For another, it may be to be perceived as moreapproachable, or more 

modern and stylish. For someone moving from finance to advertising, maybe they want to 

look ore ¡°SoHo.¡± (It¡¯s OK to use characterizations like that.) 
43.	

Look at your work environment like an anthropologist. What are the norms of your 

environment? What conveys status? Who are your most important audience? How do the people 

you respect and look up to prevent themselves? The better you understand the cultural 

context, the more control you can have over your impact.
44.	

Enlist the support of professionals and share with them your goals and context. Hire a 

personal stylist, or use the free styling service of a store like Crew. Try a hair stylist 

instead of a barber. Work with a professional photographer instead of your spouse of 

friend. It¡¯s not as expensive as you might think. 
45.	

The point of a style upgrade isn¡¯t to become more vain or to spend more time discussing 

over what to wear. Instead, use it as an opportunity to reduce decision fatigue. Pick a 

standard work uniform or a few go-to opinions. Buy all your clothes once with a stylist 

instead of shopping alone, one article of clothing a time.

Mental health is our birthright. (46) We don¡¯t have to learn how to be mentally healthy; 

it is built into us in the same way that our bodies know how to heal a cut or mend a 

broken bone. Mental health can't be learned, only reawakened. It is like the immune system 

of the body, which under stress or through lack of nutrition or exercise can be weakened, 

but which never leaves us. When we don't understand the value of mental health and we 

don't know how to gain access to it, mental health will remain hidden from us. (47) Our 

mental health doesn¡¯t really go anywhere; like the sun behind a cloud. it can be 

temporarily hidden from view, but it is fully capable of being restored in an instant. 
Mental health is the seed that contains self-esteem ¡ª confidence in ourselves and an 

ability to trust in our common sense. It allows us to have perspective on our lives ¡ª the 

ability to not take ourselves too seriously, to laugh at ourselves, to see the bigger 

picture, and to see that things will work out. It's a form of innate or unlearned 

optimism. (48) Mental health allows us to view others with sympathy if they are having 

troubles with kindness if they are in pain and with unconditional love no matter who they 

are. Mental health is the source of creativity for solving problems, resolving conflict, 

making our surroundings more beautiful, managing our home life, or coming up with a 

creative business idea or invention to make our lives easier. It gives us patience for 

ourselves and toward others as well as patience while driving, catching a fish, working on 

our car. or raising a child. It allows us to see the beauty that surrounds us each moment 

in nature, in culture, in the flow of our daily lives. 
(49)Although mental health is the cure-all for living our lives, it is perfectly ordinary 

as you will see that it has been there to direct you through all your difficult decisions. 

It has been available even in the most mundane of life situations to show you right from 

wrong, good from bad, friend from foe. Mental health has commonly been called conscience, 

instinct, wisdom, common sense, or the inner voice. We think of it simply as a healthy and 

helpful flow of intelligent thought. (50) As you will come to see, knowing that mental 

health is always available and knowing to trust it allow us to slow down to the moment and 

live life happily.

¡¡Text 1
¡¡¡¡King Juan Carlos of Spain once insisted ¡°kings don¡¯t abdicate, they dare in their 

sleep.¡± But embarrassing scandals and the popularity of the republican left in the recent 

Euro-elections have forced him to eat his words and stand down. So, does the Spanish 

crisis suggest that monarchy is seeing its last days? Does that mean the writing is on the 

wall for all European royals, with their magnificent uniforms and majestic lifestyle?
¡¡¡¡The Spanish case provides arguments both for and against monarchy. When public opinion 

is particularly polarised, as it was following the end of the Franco regime, monarchs can 

rise above ¡°mere¡± politics and ¡°embody¡± a spirit of national unity.
¡¡¡¡It is this apparent transcendence of politics that explains monarchs¡¯ continuing 

popularity polarized. And also, the Middle East excepted, Europe is the most monarch-

infested region in the world, with 10 kingdoms (not counting Vatican City and Andorra). 

But unlike their absolutist counterparts in the Gulf and Asia, most royal families have 

survived because they allow voters to avoid the difficult search for a non-controversial 

but respected public figure.
¡¡¡¡Even so, kings and queens undoubtedly have a downside. Symbolic of national unity as 

they claim to be, their very history¡ªand sometimes the way they behave today ¨C embodies 

outdated and indefensible privileges and inequalities. At a time when Thomas Piketty and 

other economists are warning of rising inequality and the increasing power of inherited 

wealth, it is bizarre that wealthy aristocratic families should still be the symbolic 

heart of modern democratic states.
¡¡¡¡The most successful monarchies strive to abandon or hide their old aristocratic ways. 

Princes and princesses have day-jobs and ride bicycles, not horses (or helicopters). Even 

so, these are wealthy families who party with the international 1%, and media 

intrusiveness makes it increasingly difficult to maintain the right image.
¡¡¡¡While Europe¡¯s monarchies will no doubt be smart enough to survive for some time to 

come, it is the British royals who have most to fear from the Spanish example.
¡¡¡¡It is only the Queen who has preserved the monarchy¡¯s reputation with her rather 

ordinary (if well-heeled) granny style. The danger will come with Charles, who has both an 

expensive taste of lifestyle and a pretty hierarchical view of the world. He has failed to 

understand that monarchies have largely survived because they provide a service ¨C as 

non-controversial and non-political heads of state. Charles ought to know that as English 

history shows, it is kings, not republicans, who are the monarchy¡¯s worst enemies.
¡¡¡¡21.  According to the first two Paragraphs, King Juan Carlos of Spain
¡¡¡¡[A] used turn enjoy high public support
¡¡¡¡[B] was unpopular among European royals
¡¡¡¡[C] cased his relationship with his rivals
¡¡¡¡[D]ended his reign in embarrassment
¡¡¡¡22. Monarchs are kept as heads of state in Europe mostly
¡¡¡¡[A] owing to their undoubted and respectable status
¡¡¡¡[B] to achieve a balance between tradition and reality
¡¡¡¡[C] to give voter more public figures to look up to
¡¡¡¡[D]due to their everlasting political embodiment
¡¡¡¡23. Which of the following is shown to be odd, according to Paragraph 4?
¡¡¡¡[A] Aristocrats¡¯ excessive reliance on inherited wealth
¡¡¡¡[B] The role of the nobility in modern democracies
¡¡¡¡[C] The simple lifestyle of the aristocratic families
¡¡¡¡[D]The nobility¡¯s adherence to their privileges
¡¡¡¡24. The British royals ¡°have most to fear¡± because Charles
¡¡¡¡[A] takes a rough line on political issues
¡¡¡¡[B] fails to change his lifestyle as advised
¡¡¡¡[C] takes republicans as his potential allies
¡¡¡¡[D] fails to adapt himself to his future role
¡¡¡¡25. Which of the following is the best title of the text?

¡¡¡¡Just how much does the Constitution protect your digital data? The Supreme Court will 

now consider whether police can search the contents of a mobile phone without a warrant if 

the phone is on or around a person during an arrest.
¡¡¡¡California has asked the justices to refrain from a sweeping ruling particularly one 

that upsets the old assumption that authorities may search through the possessions of 

suspects at the time of their arrest. It is hard, the state argues, for judges to assess 

the implications of new and rapidly changing technologies.
¡¡¡¡The court would be recklessly modest if it followed California¡¯s advice. Enough of the 

implications are discernable, even obvious, so that the justices can and should provide 

updated guidelines to police, lawyers and defendants.
¡¡¡¡They should start by discarding California¡¯s lame argument that exploring the contents 

of a smart phone ¡ª a vast storehouse of digital information ¡ª is similar to, say, 

rifling through a suspect¡¯s purse. The court has ruled that police don¡¯t violate the 

Fourth Amendment when they sift through the wallet or pocketbook of an arrestee without a 

warrant. But exploring one¡¯s smart phone is more like entering his or her home. A smart 

phone may contain an arrestee¡¯s reading history, financial history, medical history and 

comprehensive records of recent correspondence. The development of ¡°cloud computing,¡± 

meanwhile, has made that exploration so much the easier.
¡¡¡¡Americans should take steps to protect their digital privacy. But keeping sensitive 

information on these devices is increasingly a requirement of normal life. Citizens still 

have a right to expect private documents to remain private and protected by the 

Constitution¡¯s prohibition on unreasonable searches.
¡¡¡¡As so often is the case, stating that principle doesn¡¯t ease the challenge of line-

drawing. In many cases, it would not be overly onerous for authorities to obtain a warrant 

to search through phone contents. They could still invalidate Fourth Amendment protections 

when facing severe, urgent circumstances, and they could take reasonable measures to 

ensure that phone data are not erased or altered while a warrant is pending. The court, 

though, may want to allow room for police to cite situations where they are entitled to 

more freedom.
¡¡¡¡But the justices should not swallow California¡¯s argument whole. New, disruptive 

technology sometimes demands novel applications of the Constitution¡¯s protections. Orin 

Kerr, a law professor, compares the explosion and accessibility of digital information in 

the 21st century with the establishment of automobile use as a virtual necessity of life 

in the 20th: The justices had to specify novel rules for the new personal domain of the 

passenger car then; they must sort out how the Fourth Amendment applies to digital 

information now.
¡¡¡¡26.  The Supreme Court will work out whether, during an arrest, it is legitimate to
¡¡¡¡[A] prevent suspects from deleting their phone contents.
¡¡¡¡[B] search for suspects¡¯ mobile phones without a warrant.
¡¡¡¡[C] check suspects¡¯ phone contents without being authorized.
¡¡¡¡[D]prohibit suspects from using their mobile phones.
¡¡¡¡27.  The author¡¯s attitude toward California¡¯s argument is one of
¡¡¡¡[A] disapproval.
¡¡¡¡[B] indifference.
¡¡¡¡[C] tolerance.
¡¡¡¡[D]cautiousness.
¡¡¡¡28.  The author believes that exploring one¡¯s phone contents is comparable to
¡¡¡¡[A] getting into one¡¯s residence.
¡¡¡¡[B] handling one¡¯s historical records.
¡¡¡¡[C] scanning one¡¯s correspondences.
¡¡¡¡[D] going through one¡¯s wallet.
¡¡¡¡29. The author believes that exploring one¡¯s phone contents is comparable to
¡¡¡¡[A] principles are hard to be clearly expressed.
¡¡¡¡[B] the court is giving police less room for action.
¡¡¡¡[C] citizens¡¯ privacy is not effectively protected.
¡¡¡¡[D] phones are used to store sensitive information.
¡¡¡¡30.  Orin Kerr¡¯s comparison is quoted to indicate that
¡¡¡¡[A] the Constitution should be implemented flexibly.
¡¡¡¡[B] new technology requires reinterpretation of the Constitution.
¡¡¡¡[C]California¡¯s argument violates principles of the Constitution.
¡¡¡¡[D]principles of the Constitution should never be altered

¡¡¡¡The journal Science is adding an extra round of statistical checks to its peer-review 

process, editor-in-chief Marcia McNutt announced today. The policy follows similar efforts 

from other journals, after widespread concern that basic mistakes in data analysis are 

contributing to the irreproducibility of many published research findings.
¡¡¡¡¡°Readers must have confidence in the conclusions published in our journal,¡± writes 

McNutt in an editorial. Working with the American Statistical Association, the journal has 

appointed seven experts to a statistics board of reviewing editors(SBoRE). Manuscript will 

be flagged up for additional scrutiny by the journal¡¯s internal editors, or by its 

existing Board of Reviewing Editors or by outside peer reviewers. The SBoRE panel will 

then find external statisticians to review these manuscripts.
¡¡¡¡Asked whether any particular papers had impelled the change, McNutt said: ¡°The 

creation of the ¡®statistics board¡¯ was motivated by concerns broadly with the 

application of statistics and data analysis in scientific research and is part of?Science

¡¯s overall drive to increase reproducibility in the research we publish.¡±
¡¡¡¡Giovanni Parmigiani, a biostatistician at the Harvard School of Public Health, a member 

of the SBoRE group. He says he expects the board to ¡°play primarily an advisory role.¡± 

He agreed to join because he ¡°found the foresight behind the establishment of the SBoRE 

to be novel, unique and likely to have a lasting impact. This impact will not only be 

through the publications in Science itself, but hopefully through a larger group of 

publishing places that may want to model their approach after Science.¡±
¡¡¡¡John Ioannidis, a physician who studies research methodology, says that the policy is 

¡°a most welcome step forward¡± and ¡°long overdue.¡± ¡°Most journals are weak in 

statistical review, and this damages the quality of what they publish. I think that, for 

the majority of scientific papers nowadays, statistical review is more essential than 

expert review,¡± he says. But he noted that biomedical journals such as Annals of Internal 

Medicine, the Journal of the American Medical Association and The Lancet pay strong 

attention to statistical review.
¡¡¡¡Professional scientists are expected to know how to analyze data, but statistical 

errors are alarmingly common in published research, according to David Vaux, a cell 

biologist. Researchers should improve their standards, he wrote in 2012, but journals 

should also take a tougher line, ¡°engaging reviewers who are statistically literate and 

editors who can verify the process¡±. Vaux says that Science¡¯s idea to pass some papers 

to statisticians ¡°has some merit, but a weakness is that it relies on the board of 

reviewing editors to identify ¡®the papers that need scrutiny¡¯ in the first place¡±.
¡¡¡¡31. It can be learned from Paragraph 1 that
¡¡¡¡[A] Science intends to simplify their peer-review process.
¡¡¡¡[B] journals are strengthening their statistical checks.
¡¡¡¡[C] few journals are blamed for mistakes in data analysis.
¡¡¡¡[D] lack of data analysis is common in research projects.
¡¡¡¡32. The phrase ¡°flagged up¡± (Para. 2) is the closest in meaning to
¡¡¡¡[A] found.
¡¡¡¡[B] marked.
¡¡¡¡[C] revised.
¡¡¡¡[D] stored.
¡¡¡¡33. Giovanni Parmigiani believes that the establishment of the SBoRE may
¡¡¡¡[A] pose a threat to all its peers.
¡¡¡¡[B] meet with strong opposition.
¡¡¡¡[C] increase Science¡¯s circulation.
¡¡¡¡[D]set an example for other journals.¡¡
34. David Vaux holds that what Science is doing now
¡¡¡¡[A] adds to researchers¡¯ workload.
¡¡¡¡[B] diminishes the role of reviewers.
¡¡¡¡[C] has room for further improvement.
¡¡¡¡[D]is to fail in the foreseeable future
¡¡¡¡35. Which of the following is the best title of the text?
¡¡¡¡[A] Science Joins Push to Screen Statistics in Papers.
¡¡¡¡[B] Professional Statisticians Deserve More Respect
¡¡¡¡[C] Data Analysis Finds Its Way onto Editors¡¯ Desks

Text 4
¡¡¡¡Two years ago, Rupert Murdoch¡¯s daughter ,Elisabeth ,spoke of the ¡°unsettling dearth 

of integrity across so many of our institutions¡± Integrity had collapsed, she argued, 

because of a collective acceptance that the only  ¡°sorting mechanism ¡±in society should 

be profit and the market .But ¡°it¡¯s us ,human beings ,we the people who create the 

society we want ,not profit ¡±.
¡¡¡¡Driving her point home, she continued: ¡°It¡¯s increasingly apparent that the absence 

of purpose, of a moral language within government, media or business could become one of 

the most dangerous foals for capitalism and freedom.¡± This same absence of moral purpose 

was wounding companies such as News International ,shield thought ,making it more likely 

that it would lose its way as it had with widespread illegal telephone hacking .
¡¡¡¡As the hacking trial concludes ¨C finding guilty ones-editor of the News of the World, 

Andy Coulson, for conspiring to hack phones ,and finding his predecessor, Rebekah Brooks, 

innocent of the same charge ¨Cthe winder issue of dearth of integrity still standstill, 

Journalists are known to have hacked the phones of up to 5,500 people .This is hacking on 

an industrial scale ,as was acknowledged by Glenn Mulcaire, the man hired by the News of 

the World in 2001 to be the point person for phone hacking. Others await trial. This long 

story still unfolds.
¡¡¡¡In many respects, the dearth of moral purpose frames not only the fact of such 

widespread phone hacking but the terms on which the trial took place .One of the 

astonishing revelations was how little Rebekah Brooks knew of what went on in her 

newsroom, wow little she thought to ask and the fact that she never inquired wow the 

stories arrived. The core of her successful defence was that she knew nothing.
¡¡¡¡In today¡¯s world, title has become normal that well¡ªpaid executives should not be 

accountable for what happens in the organizations that they run perhaps we should not be 

so surprised. For a generation, the collective doctrine has been that the sorting 

mechanism of society should be profit. The words that have mattered are efficiency, 

flexibility, shareholder value, business¨Cfriendly, wealth generation, sales, impact and, 

in newspapers, circulation. Words degraded to the margin have been justice fairness, 

tolerance, proportionality and accountability.
¡¡¡¡The purpose of editing the News of the World was not to promote reader understanding to 

be fair in what was written or to betray any common humanity. It was to ruin lives in the 

quest for circulation and impact. Ms Brooks may or may not have had suspicions about how 

her journalists got their stories, but she asked no questions, gave no instructions¡ªnor 

received traceable, recorded answers.
¡¡¡¡36. According to the first two paragraphs, Elisabeth was upset by
¡¡¡¡[A] the consequences of the current sorting mechanism
¡¡¡¡[B] companies¡¯ financial loss due to immoral practices.
¡¡¡¡[C] governmental ineffectiveness on moral issues.
¡¡¡¡[D]the wide misuse of integrity among institutions.
¡¡¡¡37. It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that
¡¡¡¡[A] Glem Mulcaire may deny phone hacking as a crime
¡¡¡¡[B] more journalists may be found guilty of phone hacking.
¡¡¡¡[C] Andy Coulson should be held innocent of the charge.
¡¡¡¡[D] phone hacking will be accepted on certain occasions.
¡¡¡¡38. The author believes the Rebekah Books¡¯s deference
¡¡¡¡[A] revealed a cunning personality

the most suitable one from the fist A-G to fit into each of the numbered blanks. Mark your

¡¡¡¡How does your reading proceed? Clearly you try to comprehend, in the sense of 

identifying meanings for individual words and working out relationships between them, 

drawing on your explicit knowledge of English grammar (41) ______you begin to infer a 

context for the text, for instance, by making decisions about what kind of speech event is 

involved: who is making the utterance, to whom, when and where.
¡¡¡¡The ways of reading indicated here are without doubt kinds of of comprehension. But 

they show comprehension to consist not just passive assimilation but of active engagement 

inference and problem-solving. You infer information you feel the writer has invited you 

to grasp by presenting you with specific evidence and cues (42) _______
¡¡¡¡Conceived in this way, comprehension will not follow exactly the same track for each 

reader. What is in question is not the retrieval of an absolute, fixed or ¡°true¡± meaning 

that can be read off and clocked for accuracy, or some timeless relation of the text to 

the world. (43) _______
¡¡¡¡Such background material inevitably reflects who we are, (44) _______This doesn¡¯t, 

however, make interpretation merely relative or even pointless. Precisely because readers 

from different historical periods, places and social experiences produce different but 

overlapping readings of the same words on the page-including for texts that engage with 

fundamental human concerns-debates about texts can play an important role in social 

discussion of beliefs and values.
¡¡¡¡How we read a given text also depends to some extent on our particular interest in 

reading it. (45)_______such dimensions of read suggest-as others introduced later in the 

book will also do-that we bring an implicit (often unacknowledged) agenda to any act of 

reading. It doesn¡¯t then necessarily follow that one kind of reading is fuller, more 

advanced or more worthwhile than another. Ideally, different kinds of reading inform each 

other, and act as useful reference points for and counterbalances to one another. 

Together, they make up the reading component of your overall literacy or relationship to 

your surrounding textual environment.
¡¡¡¡[A] Are we studying that text and trying to respond in a way that fulfils the 

requirement of a given course? Reading it simply for pleasure? Skimming it for 

information? Ways of reading on a train or in bed are likely to differ considerably from 

reading in a seminar room.
¡¡¡¡[B] Factors such as the place and period in which we are reading, our gender ethnicity, 

age and social class will encourage us towards certain interpretation but at the same time 

obscure or even close off others.
¡¡¡¡[C] If you are unfamiliar with words or idioms, you guess at their meaning, using clues 

presented in the contest. On the assumption that they will become relevant later, you make 

a mental note of discourse entities as well as possible links between them.
¡¡¡¡[D]In effect, you try to reconstruct the likely meanings or effects that any given 

sentence, image or reference might have had: These might be the ones the author intended.
¡¡¡¡[E]You make further inferences, for instance, about how the test may be significant to 

you, or about its validity¡ªinferences that form the basis of a personal response for 

which the author will inevitably be far less responsible.
¡¡¡¡[F]In plays£¬novels and narrative poems, characters speak as constructs created by the 

author, not necessarily as mouthpieces for the author¡¯s own thoughts.
¡¡¡¡[G]Rather, we ascribe meanings to test on the basis of interaction between what we 

might call textual and contextual material: between kinds of organization or patterning we 

perceive in a text¡¯s formal structures (so especially its language structures) and 

various kinds of background, social knowledge, belief and attitude that we bring to the

Within the span of a hundred years, in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, a 

tide if emigration- one of the great folk wanderings of history- swept from Europe to 

America. (46) This movement, driven by powerful and diverse motivations, built a nation 

out of a wilderness and, by its nature, shaped the character and destiny of an uncharted 

continent. 
(47) The United States is the product of two principal forces- the immigration of European 

people with their varied ideas, customs, and national characteristics and the impact of a 

new country which modified these traits. Of necessity, colonial America was a projection 

of Europe. Across the Atlantic came successive groups of Englishmen, Frenchmen, Germans, 

Scots, Irishmen, Dutchmen, Swedes, and many others who attempt to transplant their habits 

and traditions to new world. (48) But the force of geographic conditions peculiar to 

America, the interplay of the varied national groups upon once another, and the sheer 

difficulty of maintaining old-world ways in a raw, new continent caused significant 

changes. These changes were gradual and at first scarcely visible. But the result was a 

new social pattern which, although it resembled European society in many ways, has a 

character that was distinctly American. 
(49) The first shiploads of immigrants bound for the territory which is now the United 

States crossed the Atlantic more than a hundred years after the 15th-and- 16th century 

explorations of North America. In the meantime, thriving Spanish colonies had been 

established in Mexico, the West Indies, and South America. These travelers to North 

America came in small, unmercifully overcrowded craft. During their six-to twelve-week 

voyage, they survived on barely enough food allotted to them. Many of the ships were lost 

in storms, many passengers died of disease, and infants rarely survived the journey. 

Sometimes storms blew the vessels far off their course, and often calm brought unbearably 

long delay. 
To the anxious travelers the sight of the American shore brought almost inexpressible 

relief. Said one recorder of events, ¡° The air at twelve leagues? distance smelt as sweet 

as a new-blown garden.¡± The colonists? first glimpse of the new land was a sight of dense 

woods. (50) The virgin forest with its richness and variety of trees was a real treasure-

house which extended from Maine all the way down to Georgia. Here was abundant fuel and 

lumber Here was the raw material of houses and furniture, ships and potash, dyes and naval 

stores.

I am writing to recommend to you a wonderful book, The Seventh Key, which is not only 

conductive to your study but also beneficial to your life.
¡¡¡¡The book tells a story that two nephews of an old man try hard to find the seventh key 

first in order to win the legacy. It discloses the ¡°money-first¡± attitude and 

heartlessness of people and tutors people about the life philosophy of ¡°No pains, no 

gains¡±. What¡¯s more, the beautiful language in this original English book may contribute 

to your study of English in listening, speaking, reading and writing.
¡¡¡¡I hope you would enjoy the book and share your opinion on the next reading session.
¡¡Yours sincerely,
¡¡¡¡Li Ming

¡¡¡¡Unfolded in the elaborately painted cartoon is a thought-provoking scene: four 

youngsters are sitting together to have their gathering feast. However, much of their 

attention has been attached to their mobile cell phones, totally forgetting what they are 

gathering for. Just as is put in the caption of this cartoon, it is typically a¡°Dinner 

party in mobile era.¡±
¡¡¡¡This picture is naturally associated with a wide-spreading phenomenon in contemporary 

society¡ªtoo much addiction to the mobile phones. Indeed, we have all stepped into an era 

of getting and staying in touch with others through telecommunication. Each of us seems 

close to another under this circumstance, but we have to look at the side-effect of the 

technology: the high-tech electronic products also cut off the face-to-face communication. 

To be specific, in our daily life, it¡¯s not uncommon that on buses or subways, or walking 

on the road, we are all playing with phones or pads for recreation, such as reading 

novels, watching videos or movies, surfing the Internet, and so on, even though we travel 

with our friends, parents or loved one.
¡¡¡¡Evidently, we should take a rational attitude towards this issue, but how? The media 

should promote the awareness of healthy lifestyle among the public, especially the young. 

Meanwhile, social activities, either in communities or on campuses, should be launched so 

that people can get back to the real world.

 In order to ¡°change lives for the better¡± and reduce ¡°dependency¡± George Osborne, 

Chancellor of the Exchequer, introduced the ¡°upfront work search¡± scheme. Only if the 

jobless arrive at the jobcentre with a CV, register for online job search, and start 

looking for work will they be eligible for benefit and then they should report weekly 

rather than fortnightly. What could be more reasonable?
  More apparent reasonableness followed. There will now be a seven-day wait for the 

jobseeker¡¯s allowance. ¡°Those first few days should be spent looking for work, not 

looking to sign on.¡± he claimed. ¡°We¡¯re doing these things because we know they help 

people stay off benefits and help those on benefits get into work faster.¡± Help? Really? 

On first hearing, this was the socially concerned chancellor, trying to change lives for 

the better, complete with ¡°reforms¡± to an obviously indulgent system that demands too 

little effort from the newly unemployed to find work, and subsidises laziness. What 

motivated him, we were to understand, was his zeal for ¡°fundamental fairness¡±¡ª 

protecting the taxpayer, controlling spending and ensuring that only the most deserving 

claimants received their benefits.
  Losing a job is hurting: you don¡¯t skip down to the jobcentre with a song in your 

heart, delighted at the prospect of doubling your income from the generous state. It is 

financially terrifying, psychologically embarrassing and you know that support is minimal 

and extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you support is minimal and 

extraordinarily hard to get. You are now not wanted; you are now excluded from the work 

environment that offers purpose and structure in your life. Worse, the crucial income to 

feed yourself and your family and pay the bills has disappeared. Ask anyone newly 

unemployed what they want and the answer is always: a job.
 But in Osborneland, your first instinct is to fall into dependency ¡ª permanent 

dependency if you can get it ¡ª supported by a state only too ready to indulge your 

falsehood. It is as though 20 years of ever-tougher reforms of the job search and benefit 

administration system never happened. The principle of British welfare is no longer that 

you can insure yourself against the risk of unemployment and receive unconditional 

payments if the disaster happens. Even the very phrase ¡°jobseeker¡¯s allowance¡± ¡ª 

invented in 1996 ¡ª is about redefining the unemployed as a ¡°jobseeker¡± who had no 

mandatory right to a benefit he or she has earned through making national insurance 

contributions. Instead, the claimant receives a time-limited ¡°allowance,¡± conditional on 

actively seeking a job; no entitlement and no insurance, at ¡ê71.70 a week, one of the 

least generous in the EU.

 21. George Osborne¡¯s scheme was intended to
 [A]provide the unemployed with easier access to benefits.
 [B]encourage jobseekers¡¯ active engagement in job seeking.
 [C]motivate the unemployed to report voluntarily.
 [D]guarantee jobseekers¡¯ legitimate right to benefits.
 22. The phrase, ¡°to sign on¡± (Line 3, Para. 2) most probably means
 [A]to check on the availability of jobs at the jobcentre.
 [B]to accept the government¡¯s restrictions on the allowance.
 [C]to register for an allowance from the government.
 [D]to attend a governmental job-training program.
 23. What prompted the chancellor to develop his scheme?
 [A]A desire to secure a better life for all.
 [B]An eagerness to protect the unemployed.
 [C]An urge to be generous to the claimants.
 [D]A passion to ensure fairness for taxpayers.
 24. According to Paragraph 3, being unemployed makes one feel
 [A]uneasy
 [B]enraged.
 [C]insulted.
 [D]guilty.
 25. To which of the following would the author most probably agree?
 [A]The British welfare system indulges jobseekers¡¯ laziness.
 [B]Osborne¡¯s reforms will reduce the risk of unemployment.
 [C]The jobseekers¡¯ allowance has met their actual needs.
 [D]Unemployment benefits should not be made conditional.

Text 2
 All around the world, lawyers generate more hostility than the members of any other 

profession¡ªwith the possible exception of journalism. But there are few places where 

clients have more grounds for complaint than America.
 During the decade before the economic crisis, spending on legal services in America grew 

twice as fast as inflation. The best lawyers made skyscrapers-full of money, tempting ever 

more students to pile into law schools. But most law graduates never get a big-firm job. 

Many of them instead become the kind of nuisance-lawsuit filer that makes the tort system 

a costly nightmare.
 There are many reasons for this. One is the excessive costs of a legal education. There 

is just one path for a lawyer in most American states: a four-year undergraduate degree in 

some unrelated subject, then a three-year law degree at one of 200 law schools authorized 

by the American Bar Association and an expensive preparation for the bar exam. This leaves 

today¡¯s average law-school graduate with $100,000 of debt on top of undergraduate debts. 

Law-school debt means that many cannot afford to go into government or non-profit work, 

and that they have to work fearsomely hard.
 Reforming the system would help both lawyers and their customers. Sensible ideas have 

been around for a long time, but the state-level bodies that govern the profession have 

been too conservative to implement them. One idea is to allow people to study law as an 

undergraduate degree. Another is to let students sit for the bar after only two years of 

law school. If the bar exam is truly a stern enough test for a would-be lawyer, those who 

can sit it earlier should be allowed to
 do so. Students who do not need the extra training could cut their debt mountain by a 

third.
 The other reason why costs are so high is the restrictive guild-like ownership structure 

of the business. Except in the District of Columbia, non-lawyers may not own any share of 

a law firm. This keeps fees high and innovation slow. There is pressure for change from 

within the profession, but opponents of change among the regulators insist that keeping 

outsiders out of a law firm isolates lawyers from the pressure to make money rather than 

serve clients ethically.
 In fact, allowing non-lawyers to own shares in law firms would reduce costs and improve 

services to customers, by encouraging law firms to use technology and to employ 

professional managers to focus on improving firms¡¯ efficiency. After all, other 

countries, such as Australia and Britain, have started liberalizing their legal 

professions. America should follow.
 26.a lot of students take up law as their profession due to
 [A]the growing demand from clients.
 [B]the increasing pressure of inflation.
 [C]the prospect of working in big firms.
 [D]the attraction of financial rewards.
 27.Which of the following adds to the costs of legal education in most American states?
 [A]Higher tuition fees for undergraduate studies.
 [B]Admissions approval from the bar association.
 [C]Pursuing a bachelor¡¯s degree in another major.
 [D]Receiving training by professional associations.
 28.Hindrance to the reform of the legal system originates from
 [A]lawyers¡¯ and clients¡¯ strong resistance.
 [B]the rigid bodies governing the profession.
 [C]the stem exam for would-be lawyers.
 [D]non-professionals¡¯ sharp criticism.
 29.The guild-like ownership structure is considered ¡°restrictive¡±partly because it
 [A]bans outsiders¡¯ involvement in the profession.
 [B]keeps lawyers from holding law-firm shares.
 [C]aggravates the ethical situation in the trade.
 [D]prevents lawyers from gaining due profits.
 30.In this text, the author mainly discusses
 [A]flawed ownership of America¡¯s law firms and its causes.

 The US$3-million Fundamental physics prize is indeed an interesting experiment, as 

Alexander Polyakov said when he accepted this year¡¯s award in March. And it is far from 

the only one of its type. As a News Feature article in Nature discusses, a string of 

lucrative awards for researchers have joined the Nobel Prizes in recent years. Many, like 

the Fundamental Physics Prize, are funded from the telephone-number-sized bank accounts of 

Internet entrepreneurs. These benefactors have succeeded in their chosen fields, they say, 

and they want to use their wealth to draw attention to those who have succeeded in 

science.
 What¡¯s not to like? Quite a lot, according to a handful of scientists quoted in the News 

Feature. You cannot buy class, as the old saying goes, and these upstart entrepreneurs 

cannot buy their prizes the prestige of the Nobels, The new awards are an exercise in 

self-promotion for those behind them, say scientists. They could distort the achievement-

based system of peer-review-led  research. They could cement the status quo of peer-

reviewed research. They do not fund peer-reviewed research. They perpetuate the myth of 

the lone genius.
 The goals of the prize-givers seem as scattered as the criticism. Some want to shock, 

others to draw people into science, or to better reward those who have made their careers 

in research.
 As Nature has pointed out before, there are some legitimate concerns about how science 

prizes¡ªboth new and old¡ªare distributed. The Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, 

launched this year, takes an unrepresentative view of what the life sciences include. But 

the Nobel Foundation¡¯s limit of three recipients per prize, each of whom must still be 

living, has long been outgrown by the collaborative nature of modern research¡ªas will be 

demonstrated by the inevitable row over who is ignored when it comes to acknowledging the 

discovery of the Higgs boson. The Nobels were, of course, themselves set up by a very rich 

individual who had decided what he wanted to do with his own money. Time, rather than 

intention, has given them legitimacy.
 As much as some scientists may complain about the new awards, two things seem clear. 

First, most researchers would accept such a prize if they were offered one. Second, it is 

surely a good thing that the money and attention come to science rather than go elsewhere, 

It is fair to criticize and question the mechanism¡ªthat is the culture of research, after 

all¡ªbut it is the prize-givers¡¯ money to do with as they please. It is wise to take such 

gifts with gratitude and grace.
 31. The Fundamental Physics Prize is seen as
 [A]a symbol of the entrepreneurs¡¯ wealth.
 [B]a possible replacement of the Nobel Prizes.
 [C]an example of bankers¡¯ investments.
 [D]a handsome reward for researchers.
 32. The critics think that the new awards will most benefit
 [A]the profit-oriented scientists.
 [B]the founders of the new awards.
 [C]the achievement-based system.
 [D]peer-review-led research.
 33. The discovery of the Higgs boson is a typical case which involves
 [A]controversies over the recipients¡¯ status.
 [B]the joint effort of modern researchers.
 [C]legitimate concerns over the new prizes.
 [D]the demonstration of research findings.
 34. According to Paragraph 4,which of the following is true of the Nobels?
 [A]Their endurance has done justice to them.
 [B]Their legitimacy has long been in dispute.
 [C]They are the most representative honor.
 [D]History has never cast doubt on them.
 35.The author believes that the now awards are
 [A]acceptable despite the criticism.
 [B]harmful to the culture of research.
 [C]subject to undesirable changes.
 [D]unworthy of public attention.

¡°The Heart of the Matter,¡± the just-released report by the American Academy of Arts and 

Sciences (AAAS), deserves praise for affirming the importance of the humanities and social 

sciences to the prosperity and security of liberal democracy in America. Regrettably, 

however, the report¡¯s failure to address the true nature of the crisis facing liberal 

education may cause more harm than good.
 In 2010, leading congressional Democrats and Republicans sent letters to the AAAS asking 

that it identify actions that could be taken by ¡°federal, state and local governments, 

universities, foundations, educators, individual benefactors and others¡± to ¡°maintain 

national excellence in humanities and social scientific scholarship and education.¡± In 

response, the American Academy formed the Commission on the Humanities and Social 

Sciences. Among the commission¡¯s 51 members are top-tier-university presidents, scholars, 

lawyers, judges, and business executives, as well as prominent figures from diplomacy, 

filmmaking, music and journalism.
 The goals identified in the report are generally admirable. Because representative 

government presupposes an informed citizenry, the report supports full literacy; stresses 

the study of history and government, particularly American history and American 

government; and encourages the use of new digital technologies. To encourage innovation 

and competition, the report calls for increased investment in research, the crafting of 

coherent curricula that improve students¡¯ ability to solve problems and communicate 

effectively in the 21st century, increased funding for teachers and the encouragement of 

scholars to bring their learning to bear on the great challenges of the day. The report 

also advocates greater study of foreign languages, international affairs and the expansion 

of study abroad programs.
 Unfortunately, despite 2? years in the making, "The Heart of the Matter" never gets to 

the heart of the matter: the illiberal nature of liberal education at our leading colleges 

and universities. The commission ignores that for several decades America's colleges and 

universities have produced graduates who don¡¯t know the content and character of liberal 

education and are thus deprived of its benefits. Sadly, the spirit of inquiry once at home 

on campus has been replaced by the use of the humanities and social sciences as vehicles 

for publicizing ¡°progressive,¡± or left-liberal propaganda.
 Today, professors routinely treat the progressive interpretation of history and 

progressive public policy as the proper subject of study while portraying conservative or 

classical liberal ideas¡ªsuch as free markets and self-reliance¡ªas falling outside the 

boundaries of routine, and sometimes legitimate, intellectual investigation.
 The AAAS displays great enthusiasm for liberal education. Yet its report may well set 

back reform by obscuring the depth and breadth of the challenge that Congress asked it to 

illuminate.
 36. According to Paragraph 1, what is the author¡¯s attitude toward the AAAS¡¯s report?
 [A] Critical
 [B] Appreciative
 [C] Contemptuous
 [D] Tolerant
 37. Influential figures in the Congress required that the AAAS report on how to
 [A] retain people¡¯s interest in liberal education
 [B] define the government¡¯s role in education
 [C] keep a leading position in liberal education
 [D] safeguard individuals¡¯ rights to education
 38. According to Paragraph 3, the report suggests
 [A] an exclusive study of American history
 [B] a greater emphasis on theoretical subjects
 [C] the application of emerging technologies
 [D] funding for the study of foreign languages
 39. The author implies in Paragraph 5 that professors are
 [A] supportive of free markets
 [B] cautious about intellectual investigation
 [C] conservative about public policy
 [D] biased against classical liberal ideas
 40. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?
 [A] Ways to Grasp ¡°The Heart of the Matter¡±
[B] Illiberal Education and ¡°The Heart of the Matter¡±
[C] The AAAS¡¯s Contribution to Liberal Education
 [D] Progressive Policy vs. Liberal Education

[A] Some archaeological sites have always been easily observable¡ªfor example, the 

Parthenon in Athens, Greece, the pyramids of Giza in Egypt; and the megaliths of 

Stonehenge in southern England. But these sites are exceptions to the norm. Most 

archaeological sites have been located by means of careful searching, while many others 

have been discovered by accident. Olduvai Gorge, an early hominid site in Tanzania, was 

found by a butterfly hunter who literally fell into its deep valley in 1911. Thousands of 

Aztec artifacts came to light during the digging of the Mexico City subway in the 1970s.
 [B]In another case, American archaeologists Rene Million and George Cowgill spent years 

systematically mapping the entire city of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico near what is 

now Mexico City. At its peak around AD 600, this city was one of the largest human 

settlements in the world. The researchers mapped not only the city¡¯s vast and ornate 

ceremonial areas, but also hundreds of simpler apartment complexes where common people 

lived.
 [C] How do archaeologists know where to find what they are looking for when there is 

nothing visible on the surface of the ground? Typically, they survey and sample (make test 

excavations on) large areas of terrain to determine where excavation will yield useful 

information. Surveys and test samples have also become important for understanding the 

larger landscapes that contain archaeological sites.
 [D] Surveys can cover a single large settlement or entire landscapes. In one case, many 

researchers working around the ancient Maya city of Copan, Honduras, have located hundreds 

of small rural villages and individual dwellings by using aerial photographs and by making 

surveys on foot. The resulting settlement maps show how the distribution and density of 

the rural population around the city changed dramatically between AD 500 and 850, when 

Copan collapsed.
 [E] To find their sites, archaeologists today rely heavily on systematic survey methods 

and a variety of high-technology tools and techniques. Airborne technologies, such as 

different types of radar and photographic equipment carried by airplanes or spacecraft, 

allow archaeologists to learn about what lies beneath the ground without digging. Aerial 

surveys locate general areas of interest or larger buried features, such as ancient 

buildings or fields.
 [F] Most archaeological sites, however, are discovered by archaeologists who have set out 

to look for them. Such searches can take years. British archaeologist Howard Carter knew 

that the tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Tutankhamun existed from information found in other 

sites. Carter sifted through rubble in the Valley of the Kings for seven years before he 

located the tomb in 1922. In the late 1800s British archaeologist Sir Arthur Evan combed 

antique dealers¡¯ stores in Athens, Greece. He was searching for tiny engraved seals 

attributed to the ancient Mycenaean culture that dominated Greece from the 1400s to 1200s 

BC. Evans¡¯s interpretations of these engravings eventually led him to find the Minoan 

palace at Knossos (Knoss¨®s) on the island of Crete, in 1900.
 [G] Ground surveys allow archaeologists to pinpoint the places where digs will be 

successful. Most ground surveys involve a lot of walking, looking for surface clues such 

as small fragments of pottery. They often include a certain amount of digging to test for 

buried materials at selected points across a landscape. 
Archaeologists also may locate buried remains by using such technologies as ground radar, 

magnetic-field recording, and metal detectors. Archaeologists commonly use computers to 

map sites and the landscapes around sites. Two and three-dimensional maps are helpful 

tools in planning excavations, illustrating how sites look, and presenting the results of 

archaeological research.

     Music means different things to different people and sometimes even different things 

to the same person at different moments of his life. It might be poetic, philosophical, 

sensual, or mathematical, but in any case it must, in my view, have something to do with 

the soul of the human being. Hence it is metaphysical; but the means of expression is 

purely and exclusively physical: sound. I believe it is precisely this permanent 

coexistence of metaphysical message through physical means that is the strength of music. 

(46)It is also the reason why when we try to describe music with words, all we can do is 

articulate our reactions to it, and not grasp music itself.
     Beethoven¡¯s importance in music has been principally defined by the revolutionary 

nature of his compositions. He freed music from hitherto prevailing conventions of harmony 

and structure. Sometimes I feel in his late works a will to break all signs of continuity. 

The music is abrupt and seemingly disconnected, as in the last piano sonata. In musical 

expression, he did not feel restrained by the weight of convention. (47)By all accounts he 

was a freethinking person, and a courageous one, and I find courage an essential quality 

for the understanding, let alone the performance, of his works.
     This courageous attitude in fact becomes a requirement for the performers of 

Beethoven¡¯s music. His compositions demand the performer to show courage, for example in 

the use of dynamics. (48)Beethoven¡¯s habit of increasing the volume with an intense 

crescendo and then abruptly following it with a sudden soft passage was only rarely used 

by composers before him.
     Beethoven was a deeply political man in the broadest sense of the word. He was not 

interested in daily politics, but concerned with questions of moral behavior and the 

larger questions of right and wrong affecting the entire society. (49)Especially 

significant was his view of freedom, which, for him, was associated with the rights and 

responsibilities of the individual: he advocated freedom of thought and of personal 

expression.
     Beethoven¡¯s music tends to move from chaos to order as if order were an imperative 

of human existence. For him, order does not result from forgetting or ignoring the 

disorders that plague our existence; order is a necessary development, an improvement that 

may lead to the Greek ideal of spiritual elevation. It is not by chance that the Funeral 

March is not the last movement of the Eroica Symphony, but the second, so that suffering 

does not have the last word. (50)One could interpret much of the work of Beethoven by 

saying that suffering is inevitable, but the courage to fight it renders life worth 

living.

First and foremost, I propose that we should take advantages of physical education classes 

on our campus, and not only educate students to realize the significance of the classes, 

but also to encourage students to take an active part in the classes. More importantly, we 

should attach importance to the role played by extra-curricular activates. For example, we 

could plan and organize a large number of such ball games as football games, basketball 

games and so on. 
It¡¯s my honor to share my opinions concerned with you. If you could take my advice into 

consideration, I will be highly grateful.
                                           Sincerely yours,
                                               Li Ming

As is shown above, in the first picture, along the road walked a young and vigorous 

mother, leading her girl hand in hand, with smile on her face three decades ago, while 

nowadays the daughter in the prime of her life guided her aged mother through the road arm 

in arm in the second picture. Recently there is a heated discussion about these pictures 

on Wei bo. Simple as they are, the meaning behind is as deep as ocean. 
The meaningful drawing mirrors a common phenomenon in contemporary society that there is 

the positive influence of fealty. It is universally acknowledged that supporting the aged 

is the responsibility of the sons and daughters of the Chinese people. First of all, 

emphases should be given to the cultivation of young children on respecting and loving the 

elders, which is undoubtedly an essential factor of this phenomenon. In addition, our 

government should take joint efforts to carry out effective measures on how to punish 

those who abuse the elders. Last but not the least, every individuals should keep deep in 

mind that it is the elders that contributed a lot to the rapid development of our society.
Given all the above arguments, I take the attitude that, first of all, we should show 

filial piety to parents who bring us to maturity. More importantly, the public should 

embrace and promote the awareness of filial duty which is importance for a more active and 

healthy society. In conclusion, filial piety, as a traditional Chinese virtue, is 

indispensable for us living a more valuable and fulfilling life.

¡¡¡¡People are, on the whole, poor at considering background information when making 

individual decisions. At first glance this might seem like a strength that 1 the ability 

to make judgments which are unbiased by 2 factors. But Dr. Uri Simonsohn speculated that

¡¡¡¡To 8 this idea, he turned to the university-admissions process. In theory, the 9 of an 

applicant should not depend on the few others 10 randomly for interview during the same

¡¡¡¡He studied the results of 9,323 MBA interviews, 12 by 31 admissions officers. The 

interviewers had 13 applicants on a scale of one to five. This scale 14 numerous factors

¡¡¡¡Dr Simonsohn found if the score of the previous candidate in a daily series of

choosing A, B, C or D. Mark your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1. (40 points)
¡¡¡¡Text 1
¡¡¡¡In the 2006 film version of The Devil Wears Prada, Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl 

Streep, scold her unattractive assistant for imagining that high fashion doesn¡¯t affect 

her. Priestly explains how the deep blue color of the assistant¡¯s sweater descended over 

the years from fashion shows to department stores and to the bargain bin in which the poor 

girl doubtless found her garment.
¡¡¡¡This top-down conception of the fashion business couldn¡¯t be more out of date or at 

odds with feverish world described in Overdressed, Elizabeth Cline¡¯s three-year 

indictment of ¡°fast fashion¡±. In the last decades or so, advances in technology have 

allowed mass-market labels such as Zara, H&M, and Uniqlo to react to trends more quickly 

and anticipate demand more precisely. Quckier turnrounds mean less wasted inventory, more 

frequent releases, and more profit. Those labels encourage style-conscious consumers to 

see clothes as disposal¡ª¡ª meant to last only a wash or two, although they don¡¯t 

advertise that¡ª¡ªand to renew their wardrobe every few weeks. By offering on-trend items 

at dirt-cheap prices, Cline argues, these brands have hijacked fashion cycles, shaking all 

industry long accustomed to a seasonal pace.
¡¡¡¡The victims of this revolution, of course, are not limited to designers. For H&M to 

offer a 5.95 knit miniskirt in all its 2300-plus stores around the world, it must rely on 

low-wage, overseas labor, order in volumes that strain natural resources, and use massive 

amount of harmful chemicals.
¡¡¡¡Overdressed is the fashion world¡¯s answer to consumer activist bestsellers like 

Michael Pollan¡¯s The Omnivore¡¯s Dilemma. Mass-produced clothing, like fast food, fills a 

hunger and need, yet is non-durable, and wasteful,¡± Cline argues, Americans, she finds, 

buy roughly 20 billion garments a year¡ª¡ªabout 64 items per person¡ª¡ªand no matter how 

much they give away, this excess leads to waste.
Towards the end of Overdressed, Cline introduced her ideal, a Brooklyn woman named SKB, 

who, since 2008 has make all of her own clothes¡ª¡ªand beautifully. But as Cline is the 

first to note, it took Beaumont decades to perfect her craft; her example, can¡¯t be 

knocked off.
¡¡¡¡Though several fast-fashion companies have made efforts to curb their impact on labor 

and the environment¡ª¡ªincluding H&M, with its green Conscious Collection Line¡ª¡ªCline 

believes lasting-change can only be effected by the customer. She exhibits the idealism 

common to many advocates of sustainability, be it in food or in energy. Vanity is a 

constant; people will only start shopping more sustainably when they can¡¯t afford to it.
¡¡¡¡21. Priestly criticizes her assistant for her
¡¡¡¡[A] poor bargaining skill.
¡¡¡¡[B] insensitivity to fashion.
¡¡¡¡[C] obsession with high fashion.
¡¡¡¡[D]lack of imagination.
¡¡¡¡22. According to Cline, mass-maket labels urge consumers to
¡¡¡¡[A] combat unnecessary waste.
¡¡¡¡[B] shut out the feverish fashion world.
¡¡¡¡[C] resist the influence of advertisements.
¡¡¡¡[D] shop for their garments more frequently.

¡¡¡¡An old saying has it that half of all advertising budgets are wasted-the trouble is, no 

one knows which half . In the internet age, at least in theory ,this fraction can be much 

reduced . By watching what people search for, click on and say online, companies can aim 

¡°behavioural¡± ads at those most likely to buy.
¡¡¡¡In the past couple of weeks a quarrel has illustrated the value to advertisers of such 

fine-grained information: Should advertisers assume that people are happy to be tracked 

and sent behavioural ads? Or should they have explicit permission?
In December 2010 America's Federal Trade Cornmission (FTC) proposed adding a "do not track 

"(DNT) option to internet browsers ,so that users could tell adwertisers that they did not 

want to be followed .Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Apple's Safari both offer DNT 

;Google's Chrome is due to do so this year. In February the FTC and Digltal Adwertising 

Alliance (DAA) agreed that the industry would get cracking on responging to DNT requests.
¡¡¡¡On May 31st Microsoft Set off the row: It said that Internet Explorer 10,the version 

due to appear windows 8, would have DNT as a default.
¡¡¡¡It is not yet clear how advertisers will respond. Geting a DNT signal does not oblige 

anyone to stop tracking, although some companies have promised to do so. Unable to tell 

whether someone really objects to behavioural ads or whether they are sticking with 

Microsoft¡¯s default, some may ignore a DNT signal and press on anyway.
¡¡¡¡Also unclear is why Microsoft has gone it alone. Atter all, it has an ad business too, 

which it says will comply with DNT requests, though it is still working out how. If it is 

trying to upset Google, which relies almost wholly on default will become the norm. DNT 

does not seem an obviously huge selling point for windows 8-though the firm has compared 

some of its other products favourably with Google's on that count before. Brendon Lynch, 

Microsoft's chief privacy officer, bloggde:"we believe consumers should have more 

control." Could it really be that simple?
¡¡¡¡26. It is suggested in paragraph 1 that ¡°behavioural¡± ads help advertisers to:
¡¡¡¡[A] ease competition among themselves
¡¡¡¡[B] lower their operational costs
¡¡¡¡[C] avoid complaints from consumers
¡¡¡¡[D]provide better online services
¡¡¡¡27. ¡°The industry¡± (Line 6,Para.3) refers to:
¡¡¡¡[A] online advertisers
¡¡¡¡[B] e-commerce conductors
¡¡¡¡[C] digital information analysis
¡¡¡¡[D]internet browser developers
¡¡¡¡28. Bob Liodice holds that setting DNT as a default
¡¡¡¡[A] many cut the number of junk ads
¡¡¡¡[B] fails to affect the ad industry
¡¡¡¡[C] will not benefit consumers
¡¡¡¡[D]goes against human nature
¡¡¡¡29. which of the following is ture according to Paragraph.6?
¡¡¡¡[A] DNT may not serve its intended purpose
¡¡¡¡[B] Advertisers are willing to implement DNT
[C] DNT is losing its popularity among consumers
¡¡¡¡[D] Advertisers are obliged to offer behavioural ads

¡¡Text 3
¡¡¡¡Up until a few decades ago, our visions of the future were largely - though by no means 

uniformly - glowingly positive. Science and technology would cure all the ills of 

humanity, leading to lives of fulfillment and opportunity for all.
¡¡¡¡Now utopia has grown unfashionable, as we have gained a deeper appreciation of the 

range of threats facing us, from asteroid strike to epidemic flu and to climate change. 

You might even be tempted to assume that humanity has little future to look forward to.
¡¡¡¡But such gloominess is misplaced. The fossil record shows that many species have 

endured for millions of years - so why shouldn't we? Take a broader look at our species' 

place in the universe, and it becomes clear that we have an excellent chance of surviving 

for tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of years . Look up Homo sapiens in the "Red List" 

of threatened species of the International Union for the Conversation of Nature (IUCN) 

,and you will read: "Listed as Least Concern as the species is very widely distributed, 

adaptable, currently increasing, and there are no major threats resulting in an overall 

population decline."
¡¡¡¡So what does our deep future hold? A growing number of researchers and organisations 

are now thinking seriously about that question. For example, the Long Now Foundation has 

its flagship project a medical clock that is designed to still be marking time thousands 

of years hence .
¡¡¡¡Perhaps willfully , it may be easier to think about such lengthy timescales than about 

the more immediate future. The potential evolution of today's technology, and its social 

consequences, is dazzlingly complicated, and it's perhaps best left to science fiction 

writers and futurologists to explore the many possibilities we can envisage. That's one 

reason why we have launched Arc, a new publication dedicated to the near future.
¡¡¡¡But take a longer view and there is a surprising amount that we can say with 

considerable assurance. As so often, the past holds the key to the future: we have now 

identified enough of the long-term patterns shaping the history of the planet, and our 

species, to make evidence-based forecasts about the situations in which our descendants 

will find themselves.
This long perspective makes the pessimistic view of our prospects seem more likely to be a 

passing fad. To be sure, the future is not all rosy. But we are now knowledgeable enough 

to reduce many of the risks that threatened the existence of earlier humans, and to 

improve the lot of those to come.
¡¡¡¡31. Our vision of the future used to be inspired by
¡¡¡¡[A] our desire for lives of fulfillment
¡¡¡¡[B] our faith in science and technology
¡¡¡¡[C] our awareness of potential risks
¡¡¡¡[D] our belief in equal opportunity
¡¡¡¡32. The IUCN¡¯s ¡°Red List¡± suggest that human being are
¡¡¡¡[A] a sustained species
¡¡¡¡[B] a threaten to the environment
¡¡¡¡[C] the world¡¯s dominant power
¡¡¡¡[D] a misplaced race
¡¡¡¡33. Which of the following is true according to Paragraph 5?
¡¡¡¡[A] Arc helps limit the scope of futurological studies.
¡¡¡¡[B] Technology offers solutions to social problem.
¡¡¡¡[C] The interest in science fiction is on the rise.
¡¡¡¡[D] Our Immediate future is hard to conceive.
¡¡¡¡34. To ensure the future of mankind, it is crucial to
¡¡¡¡[A] explore our planet¡¯s abundant resources
¡¡¡¡[B] adopt an optimistic view of the world
¡¡¡¡[C] draw on our experience from the past
¡¡¡¡[D] curb our ambition to reshape history
¡¡¡¡35. Which of the following would be the best title for the text?

¡¡Text 4
¡¡¡¡On a five to three vote, the Supreme Court knocked out much of Arizona¡¯s immigration 

law Monday-a modest policy victory for the Obama Administration. But on the more important 

matter of the Constitution,the decision was an 8-0 defeat for the Administration¡¯s effort 

to upset the balance of power between the federal government and the states.
¡¡¡¡In Arizona v. United States, the majority overturned three of the four contested 

provisions of Arizona¡¯s controversial plan to have state and local police enforce federal 

immigration law. The Constitutional principles that Washington alone has the power to 

¡°establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization ¡±and that federal laws precede state laws 

are noncontroversial . Arizona had attempted to fashion state policies that ran parallel 

to the existing federal ones.
Justice Anthony Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the Court¡¯s liberals, 

ruled that the state flew too close to the federal sun. On the overturned provisions the 

majority held the congress had deliberately ¡°occupied the field¡± and Arizona had thus 

intruded on the federal¡¯s privileged powers.
¡¡¡¡However,the Justices said that Arizona police would be allowed to verify the legal 

status of people who come in contact with law enforcement.That¡¯s because Congress has 

always envisioned joint federal-state immigration enforcement and explicitly encourages 

state officers to share information and cooperate with federal colleagues.
¡¡¡¡Two of the three objecting Justice-Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas-agreed with this 

Constitutional logic but disagreed about which Arizona rules conflicted with the federal 

statute.The only major objection came from Justice Antonin Scalia,who offered an even more 

robust defense of state privileges going back to the alien and Sedition Acts.
¡¡¡¡The 8-0 objection to President Obama turns on what Justice Samuel Alito describes in 

his objection as ¡°a shocking assertion assertion of federal executive power¡±.The White 

House argued that Arizona¡¯s laws conflicted with its enforcement priorities,even if state 

laws complied with federal statutes to the letter.In effect, the White House claimed that 

it could invalidate any otherwise legitimate state law that it disagrees with .
¡¡¡¡Some powers do belong exclusively to the federal government, and control of citizenship 

and the borders is among them. But if Congress wanted to prevent states from using their 

own resources to check immigration status, it could. It never did so. The administration 

was in essence asserting that because it didn¡¯t want to carry out Congress¡¯s immigration 

wishes, no state should be allowed to do so either. Every Justice rightly rejected this 

remarkable claim.
¡¡¡¡36. Three provisions of Arizona¡¯s plan were overturned because they
¡¡¡¡[A] deprived the federal police of Constitutional powers.
¡¡¡¡[B] disturbed the power balance between different states.
¡¡¡¡[C] overstepped the authority of federal immigration law.
¡¡¡¡[D] contradicted both the federal and state policies.
¡¡¡¡37. On which of the following did the Justices agree,according to Paragraph4?
¡¡¡¡[A] Federal officers¡¯ duty to withhold immigrants¡¯information.
[B] States¡¯ independence from federal immigration law.
¡¡¡¡[C] States¡¯ legitimate role in immigration enforcement.
¡¡¡¡[D] Congress¡¯s intervention in immigration enforcement.
¡¡¡¡38. It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that the Alien and Sedition Acts
¡¡¡¡[A] violated the Constitution.
¡¡¡¡[B] undermined the states¡¯ interests.
¡¡¡¡[C] supported the federal statute.
¡¡¡¡[D] stood in favor of the states.
¡¡¡¡39. The White House claims that its power of enforcement
¡¡¡¡[A] outweighs that held by the states.
¡¡¡¡[B] is dependent on the states¡¯ support.

¡¡¡¡The social sciences are flourishing.As of 2005,there were almost half a million 

professional social scientists from all fields in the world, working both inside and 

outside academia. According to the World Social Science Report 2010,the number of social-

science students worldwide has swollen by about 11% every year since 2000.
¡¡¡¡Yet this enormous resource in not contributing enough to today¡¯s global challenges 

including climate change, security,sustainable development and health.(41)______Humanity 

has the necessary agro-technological tools to eradicate hunger , from genetically 

engineered crops to arificial fertilizers . Here , too, the problems are social: the 

organization and distribution of food, wealth and prosperity.
¡¡¡¡(42)____This is a shame¡ªthe community should be grasping the opportunity to raise its 

influence in the real world. To paraphrase the great social scientist Joseph 

Schumpeter:there is no radical innovation without creative destruction .
Today ,the social sciences are largely focused on disciplinary problems and internal 

scholarly debates,rather than on topics with external impact.
¡¡¡¡Analyses reveal that the number of papers including the keywords ¡°environmental 

changed¡± or ¡°climate change¡± have increased rapidly since 2004,(43)____
¡¡¡¡When social scientists do tackle practical issues ,their scope is often local:Belgium 

is interested mainly in the effects of poverty on Belgium for example .And whether the 

community¡¯s work contributes much to an overall accumulation of knowledge is doubtful.
¡¡¡¡The problem is not necessarily the amount of available funding (44)____this is an 

adequate amount so long as it is aimed in the right direction. Social scientists who 

complain about a lack of funding should not expect more in today¡¯s economic climate.
¡¡¡¡The trick is to direct these funds better.The European Union Framework funding programs 

have long had a category specifically targeted at social scientists.This year,it was 

proposed that system be changed:Horizon 2020,a new program to be enacted in 2014,would not 

have such a category ,This has resulted in protests from social scientists.But the 

intention is not to neglect social science ; rather ,the complete opposite.(45)____That 

should create more collaborative endeavors and help to develop projects aimed directly at 

solving global problems.
¡¡¡¡[A] It could be that we are evolving two communities of social
¡¡¡¡scientists:one that is discipline-oriented and publishing in highly
¡¡¡¡specialized journals,and one that is problem-oriented and publishing
¡¡¡¡elsewhere,such as policy briefs.
¡¡¡¡[B] However,the numbers are still small:in 2010,about 1,600 of the
¡¡¡¡100,000 social-sciences papers published globally included one of these
¡¡¡¡Keywords.
¡¡¡¡[C] the idea is to force social to integrate their work with other categories, 

including health and demographic change food security, marine research and the bio-

economy, clear, efficient energy; and inclusive, innovative and secure societies.
¡¡¡¡[D] the solution is to change the mindset of the academic community, and what it 

considers to be its main goal. Global challenges and social innovation ought to receive 

much more attention from scientists, especially the young ones.
¡¡¡¡[E] These issues all have root causes in human behavior . all require behavioral change 

and social innovations , as well as technological development . Stemming climate change , 

for example , is as much about changing consumption patterns and promoting tax acceptance 

as it is about developing clean energy.
[F] Despite these factors , many social scientists seem reluctant to tackle such problems 

. And in Europe , some are up in arms over a proposal to drop a specific funding category 

for social-science research and to integrate it within cross-cutting topics of sustainable 

development .
¡¡¡¡[G] During the late 1990s , national spending on social sciences and the humanities as 

a percentage of all research and development funds-including government, higher education, 

non-profit and corporate -varied from around 4% to 25%; in most European nations , it is 

about 15%.

¡¡¡¡It is speculated that gardens arise from a basic need in the individuals who made them: 

the need for creative expression. There is no doubt that gardens evidence an impossible 

urge to create, express, fashion, and beautify and that self-expression is a basic human 

urge; (46) Yet when one looks at the photographs of the garden created by the homeless, it 

strikes one that , for all their diversity of styles, these gardens speak os various other 

fundamental urges, beyond that of decoration and creative expression.
¡¡¡¡One of these urges had to do with creating a state of peace in the midst of turbulence, 

a ¡°still point of the turning world,¡± to borrow a phrase from T. S. Eliot. (47)A sacred 

place of peace, however crude it may be, is a distinctly human need, as opposed to 

shelter, which is a distinctly animal need. This distinction is so much so that where the 

latter is lacking, as it is for these unlikely gardens, the foemer becomes all the more 

urgent. Composure is a state of mind made possible by the structuring of one¡¯s relation 

to one¡¯s environment. (48) The gardens of the homeless which are in effect homeless 

gardens introduce from into an urban environment where it either didn¡¯t exist or was not 

discernible as such. In so doing they give composure to a segment of the inarticulate 

environment in which they take their stand.
¡¡¡¡Another urge or need that these gardens appear to respond to, or to arise from is so 

intrinsic that we are barely ever conscious of its abiding claims on us. When we are 

deprived of green, of plants, of trees, (49)most of us give into a demoralization of 

spirit which we usually blame on some psychological conditions, until one day we find 

ourselves in garden and feel the expression vanish as if by magic. In most of the homeless 

gardens of New York City the actual cultivation of plants is unfeasible, yet even so the 

compositions often seem to represent attempts to call arrangement of materials, an 

institution of colors, small pool of water, and a frequent presence of petals or leaves as 

well as of stuffed animals. On display here are various fantasy elements whose reference, 

at some basic level, seems to be the natural world. (50)It is this implicit or explicit 

reference to nature that fully justifies the use of word garden though in a ¡°liberated¡± 

sense, to describe these synthetic constructions. In them we can see biophilia- a yearning 

for contact with nonhuman life-assuming uncanny representational forms.

¡¡¡¡Decisions after Graduation
¡¡¡¡Recently, there has been a growing concern among the public over the topic of the 

choice after graduation. As is described in the picture, a group of graduates is facing 

various roads such as: searching for jobs, pursuing further study, going abroad and 

entrepreneurship. The picture intends to convey to us this message: As adults, college 

students have to make decisions about their future life.
¡¡¡¡After graduation, college students have to make decisions about their future life. For 

those who are eager to become economically independent and to put into practice what they 

have learned in college, taking a job or doing poineering work will be both satisfying and 

rewarding. Getting established as a bread-winner after graduation is their main desire. By 

contrast, those who want to take advantage of the favorable conditions in college, 

however, will try to enroll in graduate programs inside or outside. For them, a Master's 

degree or even a Doctoral degree represents a much more ambitious goal than a bachelor's 

degree. In the same way, their lifetime success and interest lies more in academic 

achievements than in making money.
As far as I am concerned, it is sensible that we should take a rational attitude towards 

the decisive choice. For the part of my own, getting a higher degree abroad has long been 

my dream. This is based on my belief that I should do more research and learn more while I 

am still young.

 Come on ¨CEverybody¡¯s doing it. That whispered message, half invitation and half 

forcing, is what most of us think of when we hear the words peer pressure. It usually 

leads to no good-drinking, drugs and casual sex. But in her new book Join the Club, Tina 

Rosenberg contends that peer pressure can also be a positive force through what she calls 

the social cure, in which organizations and officials use the power of group dynamics to 

help individuals improve their lives and possibly the word.
 Rosenberg, the recipient of a Pulitzer Prize, offers a host of example of the social cure 

in action: In South Carolina, a state-sponsored antismoking program called Rage Against 

the Haze sets out to make cigarettes uncool. In South Africa, an HIV-prevention initiative 

known as LoveLife recruits young people to promote safe sex among their peers.
 The idea seems promising£¬and Rosenberg is a perceptive observer. Her critique of the 

lameness of many pubic-health campaigns is spot-on: they fail to mobilize peer pressure 

for healthy habits, and they demonstrate a seriously flawed understanding of psychology.¡± 

Dare to be different, please don¡¯t smoke!¡± pleads one billboard campaign aimed at 

reducing smoking among teenagers-teenagers, who desire nothing more than fitting in. 

Rosenberg argues convincingly that public-health advocates ought to take a page from 

advertisers, so skilled at applying peer pressure.
 But on the general effectiveness of the social cure, Rosenberg is less persuasive. Join 

the Club is filled with too much irrelevant detail and not enough exploration of the 

social and biological factors that make peer pressure so powerful. The most glaring flaw 

of the social cure as it¡¯s presented here is that it doesn¡¯t work very well for very 

long. Rage Against the Haze failed once state funding was cut. Evidence that the LoveLife 

program produces lasting changes is limited and mixed.
 There¡¯s no doubt that our peer groups exert enormous influence on our behavior. An 

emerging body of research shows that positive health habits-as well as negative ones-

spread through networks of friends via social communication. This is a subtle form of peer 

pressure: we unconsciously imitate the behavior we see every day.
  Far less certain, however, is how successfully experts and bureaucrats can select our 

peer groups and steer their activities in virtuous directions. It¡¯s like the teacher who 

breaks up the troublemakers in the back row by pairing them with better-behaved 

classmates. The tactic never really works. And that¡¯s the problem with a social cure 

engineered from the outside: in the real world, as in school, we insist on choosing our 

own friends.
  21. According to the first paragraph, peer pressure often emerges as
  [A] a supplement to the social cure
  [B] a stimulus to group dynamics
  [C] an obstacle to school progress
  [D] a cause of undesirable behaviors
  22. Rosenberg holds that public advocates should
  [A] recruit professional advertisers
  [B] learn from advertisers¡¯ experience
  [C] stay away from commercial advertisers
  [D] recognize the limitations of advertisements
23. In the author¡¯s view, Rosenberg¡¯s book fails to
  [A] adequately probe social and biological factors
  [B] effectively evade the flaws of the social cure
  [C] illustrate the functions of state funding
  [D]produce a long-lasting social effect
  24. Paragraph 5shows that our imitation of behaviors
  [A] is harmful to our networks of friends
  [B] will mislead behavioral studies
  [C] occurs without our realizing it
  [D] can produce negative health habits

  [A] harmful
  [B] desirable
  [C] profound
  [D] questionable

  A deal is a deal-except, apparently ,when Entergy is involved. The company, a major 

energy supplier in New England, provoked justified outrage in Vermont last week when it 

announced it was reneging on a longstanding commitment to abide by the strict nuclear 

regulations.
  Instead, the company has done precisely what it had long promised it would not challenge 

the constitutionality of Vermont¡¯s rules in the federal court, as part of a desperate 

effort to keep its Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant running. It¡¯s a stunning move.
  The conflict has been surfacing since 2002, when the corporation bought Vermont¡¯s only 

nuclear power plant, an aging reactor in Vernon. As a condition of receiving state 

approval for the sale, the company agreed to seek permission from state regulators to 

operate past 2012. In 2006, the state went a step further, requiring that any extension of 

the plant¡¯s license be subject to Vermont legislature¡¯s approval. Then, too, the company 

went along.
  Either Entergy never really intended to live by those commitments, or it simply didn¡¯t 

foresee what would happen next. A string of accidents, including the partial collapse of a 

cooling tower in 207 and the discovery of an underground pipe system leakage, raised 

serious questions about both Vermont Yankee¡¯s safety and Entergy¡¯s management¨C 

especially after the company made misleading statements about the pipe. Enraged by Entergy

¡¯s behavior, the Vermont Senate voted 26 to 4 last year against allowing an extension.
  Now the company is suddenly claiming that the 2002 agreement is invalid because of the 

2006 legislation, and that only the federal government has regulatory power over nuclear 

issues. The legal issues in the case are obscure: whereas the Supreme Court has ruled that 

states do have some regulatory authority over nuclear power, legal scholars say that 

Vermont case will offer a precedent-setting test of how far those powers extend. 

Certainly, there are valid concerns about the patchwork regulations that could result if 

every state sets its own rules. But had Entergy kept its word, that debate would be beside 

the point.
  The company seems to have concluded that its reputation in Vermont is already so damaged 

that it has noting left to lose by going to war with the state. But there should be 

consequences. Permission to run a nuclear plant is a poblic trust. Entergy runs 11 other 

reactors in the United States, including Pilgrim Nuclear station in Plymouth. Pledging to 

run Pilgrim safely, the company has applied for federal permission to keep it open for 

another 20 years. But as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) reviews the company¡¯s 

application, it should keep it mind what promises from Entergy are worth.
  26. The phrase ¡°reneging on¡±(Line 3.para.1) is closest in meaning to
  [A] condemning.
  [B] reaffirming.
  [C] dishonoring.
  [D] securing.
  27. By entering into the 2002 agreement, Entergy intended to
  [A] obtain protection from Vermont regulators.
  [B] seek favor from the federal legislature.
  [C] acquire an extension of its business license .
  [D] get permission to purchase a power plant.
  28. According to Paragraph 4, Entergy seems to have problems with its
  [A] managerial practices.
  [B] technical innovativeness.
  [C] financial goals.
  [D] business vision
29. In the author¡¯s view, the Vermont case will test
  [A] Entergy¡¯s capacity to fulfill all its promises.
  [B] the mature of states¡¯ patchwork regulations.
  [C] the federal authority over nuclear issues .
  [D] the limits of states¡¯ power over nuclear issues.
  30. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
  [A] Entergy¡¯s business elsewhere might be affected.
  [B] the authority of the NRC will be defied.
  [C] Entergy will withdraw its Plymouth application.
  [D] Vermont¡¯s reputation might be damaged.

  In the idealized version of how science is done, facts about the world are waiting to be 

observed and collected by objective researchers who use the scientific method to carry out 

their work. But in the everyday practice of science, discovery frequently follows an 

ambiguous and complicated route. We aim to be objective, but we cannot escape the context 

of our unique life experience. Prior knowledge and interest influence what we experience, 

what we think our experiences mean, and the subsequent actions we take. Opportunities for 

misinterpretation, error, and self-deception abound.
  Consequently, discovery claims should be thought of as protoscience. Similar to newly 

staked mining claims, they are full of potential. But it takes collective scrutiny and 

acceptance to transform a discovery claim into a mature discovery. This is the credibility 

process, through which the individual researcher¡¯s me, here, now becomes the community¡¯s 

anyone, anywhere, anytime. Objective knowledge is the goal, not the starting point.
  Once a discovery claim becomes public, the discoverer receives intellectual credit. But, 

unlike with mining claims, the community takes control of what happens next. Within the 

complex social structure of the scientific community, researchers make discoveries; 

editors and reviewers act as gatekeepers by controlling the publication process; other 

scientists use the new finding to suit their own purposes; and finally, the public 

(including other scientists) receives the new discovery and possibly accompanying 

technology. As a discovery claim works it through the community, the interaction and 

confrontation between shared and competing beliefs about the science and the technology 

involved transforms an individual¡¯s discovery claim into the community¡¯s credible 

discovery.
  Two paradoxes exist throughout this credibility process. First, scientific work tends to 

focus on some aspect of prevailing Knowledge that is viewed as incomplete or incorrect. 

Little reward accompanies duplication and confirmation of what is already known and 

believed. The goal is new-search, not re-search. Not surprisingly, newly published 

discovery claims and credible discoveries that appear to be important and convincing will 

always be open to challenge and potential modification or refutation by future 

researchers. Second, novelty itself frequently provokes disbelief. Nobel Laureate and 

physiologist Albert Azent-Gyorgyi once described discovery as ¡°seeing what everybody has 

seen and thinking what nobody has thought.¡± But thinking what nobody else has thought and 

telling others what they have missed may not change their views. Sometimes years are 

required for truly novel discovery claims to be accepted and appreciated.
  In the end, credibility ¡°happens¡± to a discovery claim ¨C a process that corresponds 

to what philosopher Annette Baier has described as the commons of the mind. ¡°We reason 

together, challenge, revise, and complete each other¡¯s reasoning and each other¡¯s 

conceptions of reason.¡±
  31. According to the first paragraph, the process of discovery is characterized by its
  [A] uncertainty and complexity.
  [B] misconception and deceptiveness.
  [C] logicality and objectivity.
  [D] systematicness and regularity.
  32. It can be inferred from Paragraph 2 that credibility process requires
  [A] strict inspection.
  [B]shared efforts.
  [C] individual wisdom.
  [D]persistent innovation.
  33.Paragraph 3 shows that a discovery claim becomes credible after it
  [A] has attracted the attention of the general public.
  [B]has been examined by the scientific community.
  [C] has received recognition from editors and reviewers.
  [D]has been frequently quoted by peer scientists.
  34. Albert Szent-Gy?rgyi would most likely agree that
  [A] scientific claims will survive challenges.
  [B]discoveries today inspire future research.
  [C] efforts to make discoveries are justified.
  [D]scientific work calls for a critical mind.
  35.Which of the following would be the best title of the test?
  [A] Novelty as an Engine of Scientific Development.
  [B]Collective Scrutiny in Scientific Discovery.
  [C] Evolution of Credibility in Doing Science.
  [D]Challenge to Credibility at the Gate to Science.

  If the trade unionist Jimmy Hoffa were alive today, he would probably represent civil 

servant. When Hoffa¡¯s Teamsters were in their prime in 1960, only one in ten American 

government workers belonged to a union; now 36% do. In 2009 the number of unionists in 

America¡¯s public sector passed that of their fellow members in the private sector. In 

Britain, more than half of public-sector workers but only about 15% of private-sector ones 

are unionized.
  There are three reasons for the public-sector unions¡¯ thriving. First, they can shut 

things down without suffering much in the way of consequences. Second, they are mostly 

bright and well-educated. A quarter of America¡¯s public-sector workers have a university 

degree. Third, they now dominate left-of-centre politics. Some of their ties go back a 

long way. Britain¡¯s Labor Party, as its name implies, has long been associated with trade 

unionism. Its current leader, Ed Miliband, owes his position to votes from public-sector 

unions.
  At the state level their influence can be even more fearsome. Mark Baldassare of the 

Public Policy Institute of California points out that much of the state¡¯s budget is 

patrolled by unions. The teachers¡¯ unions keep an eye on schools, the CCPOA on prisons 

and a variety of labor groups on health care.
  In many rich countries average wages in the state sector are higher than in the private 

one. But the real gains come in benefits and work practices. Politicians have repeatedly 

¡°backloaded¡± public-sector pay deals, keeping the pay increases modest but adding to 

holidays and especially pensions that are already generous.
  Reform has been vigorously opposed, perhaps most egregiously in education, where charter 

schools, academies and merit pay all faced drawn-out battles. Even though there is plenty 

of evidence that the quality of the teachers is the most important variable, teachers¡¯ 

unions have fought against getting rid of bad ones and promoting good ones.
  As the cost to everyone else has become clearer, politicians have begun to clamp down. 

In Wisconsin the unions have rallied thousands of supporters against Scott Walker, the 

hardline Republican governor. But many within the public sector suffer under the current 

system, too.
  John Donahue at Harvard¡¯s Kennedy School points out that the norms of culture in 

Western civil services suit those who want to stay put but is bad for high achievers. The 

only American public-sector workers who earn well above $250,000 a year are university 

sports coaches and the president of the United States. Bankers¡¯ fat pay packets have 

attracted much criticism, but a public-sector system that does not reward high achievers 

may be a much bigger problem for America.
  36. It can be learned from the first paragraph that
  [A] Teamsters still have a large body of members.
  [B] Jimmy Hoffa used to work as a civil servant.
  [C] unions have enlarged their public-sector membership.
  [D]the government has improved its relationship with unionists.
  37. Which of the following is true of Paragraph 2?
  [A] Public-sector unions are prudent in taking actions.
  [B] Education is required for public-sector union membership.
  [C] Labor Party has long been fighting against public-sector unions.
  [D]Public-sector unions seldom get in trouble for their actions.
  38. It can be learned from Paragraph 4 that the income in the state sector is
  [A] illegally secured.
  [B] indirectly augmented.
  [C] excessively increased.
  [D]fairly adjusted.
  39. The example of the unions in Wisconsin shows that unions
  [A]often run against the current political system.
  [B]can change people¡¯s political attitudes.
  [C]may be a barrier to public-sector reforms.
  [D]are dominant in the government.
  40. John Donahue¡¯s attitude towards the public-sector system is one of
  [A]disapproval.
  [B]appreciation.
  [C]tolerance.
  [D]indifference.

  Think of those fleeting moments when you look out of an aeroplane window and realise 

that you are flying, higher than a bird. Now think of your laptop, thinner than a brown-

paper envelope, or your cellphone in the palm of your hand. Take a moment or two to wonder 

at those marvels. You are the lucky inheritor of a dream come true.
  The second half of the 20th century saw a collection of geniuses, warriors, 

entrepreneurs and visionaries labour to create a fabulous machine that could function as a 

typewriter and printing press, studio and theatre, paintbrush and gallery, piano and 

radio, the mail as well as the mail carrier. (41)
  The networked computer is an amazing device, the first media machine that serves as the 

mode of production, means of distribution, site of reception, and place of praise and 

critique. The computer is the 21st century's culture machine.
  But for all the reasons there are to celebrate the computer, we must also tread with 

caution. (42)I call it a secret war for two reasons. First, most people do not realise 

that there are strong commercial agendas at work to keep them in passive consumption mode. 

Second, the majority of people who use networked computers to upload are not even aware of 

the significance of what they are doing.
  All animals download, but only a few upload. Beavers build dams and birds make nests. 

Yet for the most part, the animal kingdom moves through the world downloading. Humans are 

unique in their capacity to not only make tools but then turn around and use them to 

create superfluous material goods - paintings, sculpture and architecture - and 

superfluous experiences - music, literature, religion and philosophy. (43)
  For all the possibilities of our new culture machines, most people are still stuck in 

download mode. Even after the advent of widespread social media, a pyramid of production 

remains, with a small number of people uploading material, a slightly larger group 

commenting on or modifying that content, and a huge percentage remaining content to just 

consume. (44)
  Television is a one-way tap flowing into our homes. The hardest task that television 

asks of anyone is to turn the power off after he has turned it on.
  (45)
  What counts as meaningful uploading? My definition revolves around the concept of 

"stickiness" - creations and experiences to which others adhere.
  [A] Of course, it is precisely these superfluous things that define human culture and 

ultimately what it is to be human. Downloading and consuming culture requires great 

skills, but failing to move beyond downloading is to strip oneself of a defining 

constituent of humanity.
  [B] Applications like tumblr.com, which allow users to combine pictures, words and other 

media in creative ways and then share them, have the potential to add stickiness by 

amusing, entertaining and enlightening others.
  [C] Not only did they develop such a device but by the turn of the millennium they had 

also managed to embed it in a worldwide system accessed by billions of people every day.
  [D] This is because the networked computer has sparked a secret war between downloading 

and uploading - between passive consumption and active creation - whose outcome will shape 

our collective future in ways we can only begin to imagine.
  [E] The challenge the computer mounts to television thus bears little similarity to one 

format being replaced by another in the manner of record players being replaced by CD 

players.
  [F] One reason for the persistence of this pyramid of production is that for the past 

half-century, much of the world's media culture has been defined by a single medium - 

television - and television is defined by downloading.
  [G]The networked computer offers the first chance in 50 years to reverse the flow, to 

encourage thoughtful downloading and, even more importantly, meaningful uploading.

  Since the days of Aristotle, a search for universal principles has characterized the 

scientific enterprise. In some ways, this quest for commonalities defines science. Newton

¡¯s laws of motion and Darwinian evolution each bind a host of different phenomena into a 

single explicatory frame work.
  (46)In physics, one approach takes this impulse for unification to its extreme, and 

seeks a theory of everything¡ªa single generative equation for all we see.It is becoming 

less clear, however, that such a theory would be a simplification, given the dimensions 

and universes that it might entail, nonetheless, unification of sorts remains a major 

goal.
  This tendency in the natural sciences has long been evident in the social sciences too. 

(47)Here, Darwinism seems to offer justification for it all humans share common origins it 

seems reasonable to suppose that cultural diversity could also be traced to more 

constrained beginnings. Just as the bewildering variety of human courtship rituals might 

all be considered forms of sexual selection, perhaps the world¡¯s languages, music, social 

and religious customs and even history are governed by universal features. (48)To filter 

out what is unique from what is shared might enable us to understand how complex cultural 

behavior arose and what guides it in evolutionary or cognitive terms.
  That, at least, is the hope. But a comparative study of linguistic traits published 

online today supplies a reality check. Russell Gray at the University of Auckland and his 

colleagues consider the evolution of grammars in the light of two previous attempts to 

find universality in language.
  The most famous of these efforts was initiated by Noam Chomsky, who suggested that 

humans are born with an innate language¡ªacquisition capacity that dictates a universal 

grammar. A few generative rules are then sufficient to unfold the entire fundamental 

structure of a language, which is why children can learn it so quickly.
(49)The second, by Joshua Greenberg, takes a more empirical approach to universality 

identifying traits (particularly in word order) shared by many language which are 

considered to represent biases that result from cognitive constraints
  Gray and his colleagues have put them to the test by examining four family trees that 

between them represent more than 2,000 languages.(50)Chomsky¡¯s grammar should show 

patterns of language change that are independent of the family tree or the pathway tracked 

through it. Whereas Greenbergian universality predicts strong co-dependencies between 

particular types of word-order relations. Neither of these patterns is borne out by the 

analysis, suggesting that the structures of the languages are lire age-specific and not 

governed by universals

Text 1
The decision of the New York Philharmonic to hire Alan Gilbert as its next music director 

has been the talk of the classical-music world ever since the sudden announcement of his 

appointment in 2009. For the most part, the response has been favorable, to say the least. 

¡°Hooray! At last!¡± wrote Anthony Tommasini, a sober-sided classical-music critic.
One of the reasons why the appointment came as such a surprise, however, is that Gilbert 

is comparatively little known. Even Tommasini, who had advocated Gilbert¡¯s appointment in 

the Times, calls him ¡°an unpretentious musician with no air of the formidable conductor 

about him.¡± As a description of the next music director of an orchestra that has hitherto 

been led by musicians like Gustav Mahler and Pierre Boulez, that seems likely to have 

struck at least some Times readers as faint praise.
For my part, I have no idea whether Gilbert is a great conductor or even a good one. To be 

sure, he performs an impressive variety of interesting compositions, but it is not 

necessary for me to visit Avery Fisher Hall, or anywhere else, to hear interesting 

orchestral music. All I have to do is to go to my CD shelf, or boot up my computer and 

download still more recorded music from iTunes.
Devoted concertgoers who reply that recordings are no substitute for live performance are 

missing the point. For the time, attention, and money of the art-loving public, classical 

instrumentalists must compete not only with opera houses, dance troupes, theater 

companies, and museums, but also with the recorded performances of the great classical 

musicians of the 20th century. There recordings are cheap, available everywhere, and very 

often much higher in artistic quality than today¡¯s live performances; moreover, they can 

be ¡°consumed¡± at a time and place of the listener¡¯s choosing. The widespread 

availability of such recordings has thus brought about a crisis in the institution of the 

traditional classical concert.
One possible response is for classical performers to program attractive new music that is 

not yet available on record. Gilbert¡¯s own interest in new music has been widely noted: 

Alex Ross, a classical-music critic, has described him as a man who is capable of turning 

the Philharmonic into ¡°a markedly different, more vibrant organization.¡± But what will 

be the nature of that difference? Merely expanding the orchestra¡¯s repertoire will not be 

enough. If Gilbert and the Philharmonic are to succeed, they must first change the 

relationship between America¡¯s oldest orchestra and the new audience it hops to attract.
21. We learn from Para.1 that Gilbert¡¯s appointment has
[A]incurred criticism.    [B]raised suspicion.   [C]received acclaim.   [D]aroused 

curiosity.
22. Tommasini regards Gilbert as an artist who is 
[A]influential.   [B]modest.   [C]respectable.   [D]talented.
23. The author believes that the devoted concertgoers
[A]ignore the expenses of live performances.   [B]reject most kinds of recorded 

performances.
[C]exaggerate the variety of live performances. [D]overestimate the value of live 

performances.
24. According to the text, which of the following is true of recordings?
[A]They are often inferior to live concerts in quality.
[B]They are easily accessible to the general public.
[C]They help improve the quality of music.    [D]They have only covered masterpieces.
25. Regarding Gilbert¡¯s role in revitalizing the Philharmonic, the author feels
[A]doubtful.  [B]enthusiastic.   [C]confident.  [D]puzzled.

Text 2
When Liam McGee departed as president of Bank of America in August, his explanation was 

surprisingly straight up. Rather than cloaking his exit in the usual vague excuses, he 

came right out and said he was leaving ¡°to pursue my goal of running a company.¡± 

Broadcasting his ambition was ¡°very much my decision,¡± McGee says. Within two weeks, he 

was talking for the first time with the board of Hartford Financial Services Group, which 

named him CEO and chairman on September 29.
McGee says leaving without a position lined up gave him time to reflect on what kind of 

company he wanted to run. It also sent a clear message to the outside world about his 

aspirations. And McGee isn¡¯t alone. In recent weeks the No.2 executives at Avon and 

American Express quit with the explanation that they were looking for a CEO post. As 

boards scrutinize succession plans in response to shareholder pressure, executives who don

¡¯t get the nod also may wish to move on. A turbulent business environment also has senior 

managers cautious of letting vague pronouncements cloud their reputations. 
As the first signs of recovery begin to take hold, deputy chiefs may be more willing to 

make the jump without a net. In the third quarter, CEO turnover was down 23% from a year 

ago as nervous boards stuck with the leaders they had, according to Liberum Research. As 

the economy picks up, opportunities will abound for aspiring leaders.
The decision to quit a senior position to look for a better one is unconventional. For 

years executives and headhunters have adhered to the rule that the most attractive CEO 

candidates are the ones who must be poached. Says Korn/Ferry senior partner Dennis Carey:

¡±I can¡¯t think of a single search I¡¯ve done where a board has not instructed me to look 

at sitting CEOs first.¡±
Those who jumped without a job haven¡¯t always landed in top positions quickly. Ellen 

Marram quit as chief of Tropicana a decade age, saying she wanted to be a CEO. It was a 

year before she became head of a tiny Internet-based commodities exchange. Robert 

Willumstad left Citigroup in 2005 with ambitions to be a CEO. He finally took that post at 

a major financial institution three years later.
Many recruiters say the old disgrace is fading for top performers. The financial crisis 

has made it more acceptable to be between jobs or to leave a bad one. ¡°The traditional 

rule was it¡¯s safer to stay where you are, but that¡¯s been fundamentally inverted,¡± 

says one headhunter. ¡°The people who¡¯ve been hurt the worst are those who¡¯ve stayed too 

long.¡±
26. When McGee announced his departure, his manner can best be described as being
[A]arrogant.  [B]frank.  [C]self-centered.  [D]impulsive.
27. According to Paragraph 2, senior executives¡¯ quitting may be spurred by
[A]their expectation of better financial status.  [B]their need to reflect on their 

private life.
[C]their strained relations with the boards.     [D]their pursuit of new career goals.
28. The word ¡°poached¡± (Line 3, Paragraph 4) most probably means
[A]approved of.  [B]attended to.  [C]hunted for.   [D]guarded against.
29. It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
[A]top performers used to cling to their posts. [B]loyalty of top performers is getting 

out-dated.
[C]top performers care more about reputations. [D]it¡¯s safer to stick to the traditional 

rules.
30. Which of the following is the best title for the text?
[A]CEOs: Where to Go?                 [B]CEOs: All the Way Up?

Text 3
The rough guide to marketing success used to be that you got what you paid for. No longer. 

While traditional ¡°paid¡± media ¨C such as television commercials and print 

advertisements ¨C still play a major role, companies today can exploit many alternative 

forms of media. Consumers passionate about a product may create ¡°owned¡± media by sending 

e-mail alerts about products and sales to customers registered with its Web site. The way 

consumers now approach the broad range of factors beyond conventional paid media.
Paid and owned media are controlled by marketers promoting their own products. For earned 

media , such marketers act as the initiator for users¡¯ responses. But in some cases, one 

marketer¡¯s owned media become another marketer¡¯s paid media ¨C for instance, when an e-

commerce retailer sells ad space on its Web site. We define such sold media as owned media 

whose traffic is so strong that other organizations place their content or e-commerce 

engines within that environment. This trend ,which we believe is still in its infancy, 

effectively began with retailers and travel providers such as airlines and hotels and will 

no doubt go further. Johnson & Johnson, for example, has created BabyCenter, a stand-alone 

media property that promotes complementary and even competitive products. Besides 

generating income, the presence of other marketers makes the site seem objective, gives 

companies opportunities to learn valuable information about the appeal of other companies

¡¯ marketing, and may help expand user traffic for all companies concerned.
The same dramatic technological changes that have provided marketers with more (and more 

diverse) communications choices have also increased the risk that passionate consumers 

will voice their opinions in quicker, more visible, and much more damaging ways. Such 

hijacked media are the opposite of earned media: an asset or campaign becomes hostage to 

consumers, other stakeholders, or activists who make negative allegations about a brand or 

product. Members of social networks, for instance, are learning that they can hijack media 

to apply pressure on the businesses that originally created them.
If that happens, passionate consumers would try to persuade others to boycott products, 

putting the reputation of the target company at risk. In such a case, the company¡¯s 

response may not be sufficiently quick or thoughtful, and the learning curve has been 

steep. Toyota Motor, for example, alleviated some of the damage from its recall crisis 

earlier this year with a relatively quick and well-orchestrated social-media response 

campaign, which included efforts to engage with consumers directly on sites such as 

Twitter and the social-news site Digg.
31.Consumers may create ¡°earned¡± media when they are 
[A] obscssed with online shopping at certain Web sites. 
[B] inspired by product-promoting e-mails sent to them. 
[C] eager to help their friends promote quality products.
[D] enthusiastic about recommending their favorite products. 
32. According to Paragraph 2,sold media feature 
[A] a safe business environment.        [B] random competition. 
[C] strong user traffic.                 [D] flexibility in organization. 
33. The author indicates in Paragraph 3 that earned media
[A] invite constant conflicts with passionate consumers. 
[B] can be used to produce negative effects in marketing. 
[C] may be responsible for fiercer competition.
[D] deserve all the negative comments about them.
34. Toyota Motor¡¯s experience is cited as an example of 
[A] responding effectively to hijacked media.[B] persuading customers into boycotting 

products.
[C] cooperating with supportive consumers. [D] taking advantage of hijacked media.
35. Which of the following is the text mainly about ?
[A] Alternatives to conventional paid media.[B] Conflict between hijacked and earned 

media.
[C] Dominance of hijacked media.        [D] Popularity of owned media.

Text 4
It¡¯s no surprise that Jennifer Senior¡¯s insightful, provocative magazine cover story, ¡°

I love My Children, I Hate My Life,¡± is arousing much chatter ¨C nothing gets people 

talking like the suggestion that child rearing is anything less than a completely 

fulfilling, life-enriching experience. Rather than concluding that children make parents 

either happy or miserable, Senior suggests we need to redefine happiness: instead of 

thinking of it as something that can be measured by moment-to-moment joy, we should 

consider being happy as a past-tense condition. Even though the day-to-day experience of 

raising kids can be soul-crushingly hard, Senior writes that ¡°the very things that in the 

moment dampen our moods can later be sources of intense gratification and delight.¡±
The magazine cover showing an attractive mother holding a cute baby is hardly the only 

Madonna-and-child image on newsstands this week. There are also stories about newly 

adoptive ¨C and newly single ¨C mom Sandra Bullock, as well as the usual ¡°Jennifer 

Aniston is pregnant¡± news. Practically every week features at least one celebrity mom, or 

mom-to-be, smiling on the newsstands.
In a society that so persistently celebrates procreation, is it any wonder that admitting 

you regret having children is equivalent to admitting you support kitten-killing ? It 

doesn¡¯t seem quite fair, then, to compare the regrets of parents to the regrets of the 

children. Unhappy parents rarely are provoked to wonder if they shouldn¡¯t have had kids, 

but unhappy childless folks are bothered with the message that children are the single 

most important thing in the world: obviously their misery must be a direct result of the 

gaping baby-size holes in their lives.
Of course, the image of parenthood that celebrity magazines like Us Weekly and People 

present is hugely unrealistic, especially when the parents are single mothers like 

Bullock. According to several studies concluding that parents are less happy than 

childless couples, single parents are the least happy of all. No shock there, considering 

how much work it is to raise a kid without a partner to lean on; yet to hear Sandra and 

Britney tell it, raising a kid on their ¡°own¡± (read: with round-the-clock help) is a 

piece of cake.
It¡¯s hard to imagine that many people are dumb enough to want children just because Reese 

and Angelina make it look so glamorous: most adults understand that a baby is not a 

haircut. But it¡¯s interesting to wonder if the images we see every week of stress-free, 

happiness-enhancing parenthood aren¡¯t in some small, subconscious way contributing to our 

own dissatisfactions with the actual experience, in the same way that a small part of us 

hoped getting ¡° the Rachel¡± might make us look just a little bit like Jennifer Aniston.
36.Jennifer Senior suggests in her article that raising a child can bring
[A]temporary delight                [B]enjoyment in progress
[C]happiness in retrospect            [D]lasting reward
37.We learn from Paragraph 2 that
[A]celebrity moms are a permanent source for gossip.
[B]single mothers with babies deserve greater attention.
[C]news about pregnant celebrities is entertaining.
[D]having children is highly valued by the public.
38.It is suggested in Paragraph 3 that childless folks
[A]are constantly exposed to criticism.         [B]are largely ignored by the media.
[C]fail to fulfill their social responsibilities.     [D]are less likely to be satisfied 

with their life.
39.According to Paragraph 4, the message conveyed by celebrity magazines is
[A]soothing   .[B]ambiguous.  [C]compensatory.  [D]misleading.
40.Which of the following can be inferred from the last paragraph?
[A]Having children contributes little to the glamour of celebrity moms.
[B]Celebrity moms have influenced our attitude towards child rearing.
[C]Having children intensifies our dissatisfaction with life.
[D]We sometimes neglect the happiness from child rearing.

[A] No disciplines have seized on professionalism with as much enthusiasm as the 

humanities. You can, Mr Menand points out, became a lawyer in three years and a medical 

doctor in four. But the regular time it takes to get a doctoral degree in the humanities 

is nine years. Not surprisingly, up to half of all doctoral students in English drop out 

before getting their degrees.
[B] His concern is mainly with the humanities: Literature, languages, philosophy and so 

on. These are disciplines that are going out of style: 22% of American college graduates 

now major in business compared with only 2% in history and 4% in English. However, many 

leading American universities want their undergraduates to have a grounding in the basic 

canon of ideas that every educated person should posses. But most find it difficult to 

agree on what a ¡°general education¡± should look like. At Harvard, Mr Menand notes, ¡°the 

great books are read because they have been read¡±-they form a sort of social glue.
[C] Equally unsurprisingly, only about half end up with professorships for which they 

entered graduate school. There are simply too few posts. This is partly because 

universities continue to produce ever more PhDs. But fewer students want to study 

humanities subjects: English departments awarded more bachelor¡¯s degrees in 1970-71 than 

they did 20 years later. Fewer students requires fewer teachers. So, at the end of a 

decade of theses-writing, many humanities students leave the profession to do something 

for which they have not been trained.
[D] One reason why it is hard to design and teach such courses is that they can cut across 

the insistence by top American universities that liberal-arts educations and professional 

education should be kept separate, taught in different schools. Many students experience 

both varieties. Although more than half of Harvard undergraduates end up in law, medicine 

or business, future doctors and lawyers must study a non-specialist liberal-arts degree 

before embarking on a professional qualification.
[E] Besides professionalizing the professions by this separation, top American 

universities have professionalised the professor. The growth in public money for academic 

research has speeded the process: federal research grants rose fourfold between 1960and 

1990, but faculty teaching hours fell by half as research took its toll. Professionalism 

has turned the acquisition of a doctoral degree into a prerequisite for a successful 

academic career: as late as 1969a third of American professors did not possess one. But 

the key idea behind professionalisation, argues Mr Menand, is that ¡°the knowledge and 

skills needed for a particular specialization are transmissible but not transferable.¡±So 

disciplines acquire a monopoly not just over the production of knowledge, but also over 

the production of the producers of knowledge.
[F] The key to reforming higher education, concludes Mr Menand, is to alter the way in 

which ¡°the producers of knowledge are produced.¡±Otherwise, academics will continue to 

think dangerously alike, increasingly detached from the societies which they study, 

investigate and criticize.¡±Academic inquiry, at least in some fields, may need to become 

less exclusionary and more holistic.¡±Yet quite how that happens, Mr Menand dose not say.
[G] The subtle and intelligent little book The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance 

in the American University should be read by every student thinking of applying to take a 

doctoral degree. They may then decide to go elsewhere. For something curious has been 

happening in American Universities, and Louis Menand, a professor of English at Harvard 

University, captured it skillfully.

With its theme that ¡°Mind is the master weaver,¡± creating our inner character and outer 

circumstances, the book As a Man Thinking by James Allen is an in-depth exploration of the 

central idea of self-help writing.
(46) Allen¡¯s contribution was to take an assumption we all share-that because we are not 

robots we therefore control our thoughts-and reveal its erroneous nature. Because most of 

us believe that mind is separate from matter, we think that thoughts can be hidden and 

made powerless; this allows us to think one way and act another. However, Allen believed 

that the unconscious mind generates as much action as the conscious mind, and (47) while 

we may be able to sustain the illusion of control through the conscious mind alone, in 

reality we are continually faced with a question: ¡°Why cannot I make myself do this or 

achieve that? ¡±
Since desire and will are damaged by the presence of thoughts that do not accord with 

desire, Allen concluded : ¡° We do not attract what we want, but what we are.¡± 

Achievement happens because you as a person embody the external achievement; you don¡¯t ¡° 

get¡± success but become it. There is no gap between mind and matter.
Part of the fame of Allen¡¯s book is its contention that ¡°Circumstances do not make a 

person, they reveal him.¡± (48) This seems a justification for neglect of those in need, 

and a rationalization of exploitation, of the superiority of those at the top and the 

inferiority of those at the bottom.
This ,however, would be a knee-jerk reaction to a subtle argument. Each set of 

circumstances, however bad, offers a unique opportunity for growth. If circumstances 

always determined the life and prospects of people, then humanity would never have 

progressed. In fat, (49)circumstances seem to be designed to bring out the best in us and 

if we feel that we have been ¡°wronged¡± then we are unlikely to begin a conscious effort 

to escape from our situation .Nevertheless, as any biographer knows, a person¡¯s early 

life and its conditions are often the greatest gift to an individual.
The sobering aspect of Allen¡¯s book is that we have no one else to blame for our present 

condition except ourselves. (50) The upside is the possibilities contained in knowing that 

everything is up to us; where before we were experts in the array of limitations, now we 

become authorities of what is possible.

In 1924 America's National Research Council sent two engineers to supervise a series of 

industrial experiments at a large telephone-parts factory called the Hawthorne Plant near 

Chicago. It hoped they would learn how stop-floor lighting  1  workers' productivity. 

Instead, the studies ended  2  giving their name to the "Hawthorne effect", the 

extremely influential idea that the very  3  to being experimented upon changed 

subjects' behavior.
The idea arose because of the  4  behavior of the women in the Hawthorne plant. 

According to  5  of the experiments, their hourly output rose when lighting was

Text 1
Of all the changes that have taken place in English-language newspapers during the past 

quarter-century, perhaps the most far-reaching has been the inexorable decline in the 

scope and seriousness of their arts coverage. 
It is difficult to the point of impossibility for the average reader under the age of 

forty to imagine a time when high-quality arts criticism could be found in most big-city 

newspapers. Yet a considerable number of the most significant collections of criticism 

published in the 20th century consisted in large part of newspaper reviews. To read such 

books today is to marvel at the fact that their learned contents were once deemed suitable 

for publication in general-circulation dailies.
We are even farther removed from the unfocused newspaper reviews published in England 

between the turn of the 20th century and the eve of World War II, at a time when newsprint 

was dirt-cheap and stylish arts criticism was considered an ornament to the publications 

in which it appeared. In those far-off days, it was taken for granted that the critics of 

major papers would write in detail and at length about the events they covered. Theirs was 

a serious business, and even those reviewers who wore their learning lightly, like George 

Bernard Shaw and Ernest Newman, could be trusted to know what they were about. These men 

believed in journalism as a calling, and were proud to be published in the daily press. ¡°

So few authors have brains enough or literary gift enough to keep their own end up in 

journalism,¡± Newman wrote, ¡°that I am tempted to define ¡®journalism¡¯ as ¡®a term of 

contempt applied by writers who are not read to writers who are.¡¯¡±
Unfortunately, these critics are virtually forgotten. Neville Cardus, who wrote for the 

Manchester Guardian from 1917 until shortly before his death in 1975, is now known solely 

as a writer of essays on the game of cricket. During his lifetime, though, he was also one 

of England¡¯s foremost classical-music critics, a stylist so widely admired that his 

Autobiography (1947) became a best-seller. He was knighted in 1967, the first music critic 

to be so honored. Yet only one of his books is now in print, and his vast body of writings 

on music is unknown save to specialists.
Is there any chance that Cardus¡¯s criticism will enjoy a revival? The prospect seems 

remote. Journalistic tastes had changed long before his death, and postmodern readers have 

little use for the richly upholstered Vicwardian prose in which he specialized. Moreover, 

the amateur tradition in music criticism has been in headlong retreat.

21.	It is indicated in Paragraphs 1 and 2 that
[A] arts criticism has disappeared from big-city newspapers.
[B] English-language newspapers used to carry more arts reviews.
[C] high-quality newspapers retain a large body of readers.
[D] young readers doubt the suitability of criticism on dailies.
22.	Newspaper reviews in England before World War II were characterized by
[A] free themes.
[B] casual style.
[C] elaborate layout.
[D] radical viewpoints.
23.	Which of the following would Shaw and Newman most probably agree on?
[A] It is writers' duty to fulfill journalistic goals.
[B] It is contemptible for writers to be journalists.
[C] Writers are likely to be tempted into journalism.
[D] Not all writers are capable of journalistic writing.
24.	What can be learned about Cardus according to the last two paragraphs?
[A] His music criticism may not appeal to readers today.
[B] His reputation as a music critic has long been in dispute.
[C] His style caters largely to modern specialists.
[D] His writings fail to follow the amateur tradition.

Over the past decade, thousands of patents have been granted for what are called business 

methods. Amazon.com received one for its "one-click" online payment system. Merrill Lynch 

got legal protection for an asset allocation strategy. One inventor patented a technique 

for lifting a box.
Now the nation's top patent court appears completely ready to scale back on business-

method patents, which have been controversial ever since they were first authorized 10 

years ago. In a move that has intellectual-property lawyers abuzz the U.S. court of 

Appeals for the federal circuit said it would use a particular case to conduct a broad 

review of business-method patents. In re Bilski, as the case is known , is "a very big 

deal", says Dennis D. Crouch of the University of Missouri School of law. It "has the 

potential to eliminate an entire class of patents."
Curbs on business-method claims would be a dramatic about-face, because it was the federal 

circuit itself that introduced such patents with its 1998 decision in the so-called state 

Street Bank case, approving a patent on a way of pooling mutual-fund assets. That ruling 

produced an explosion in business-method patent filings, initially by emerging internet 

companies trying to stake out exclusive rights to specific types of online transactions. 

Later, more established companies raced to add such patents to their files, if only as a 

defensive move against rivals that might beat them to the punch. In 2005, IBM noted in a 

court filing that it had been issued more than 300 business-method patents despite the 

fact that it questioned the legal basis for granting them. Similarly, some Wall Street 

investment films armed themselves with patents for financial products, even as they took 

positions in court cases opposing the practice.
The Bilski case involves a claimed patent on a method for hedging risk in the energy 

market. The Federal circuit issued an unusual order stating that the case would be heard 

by all 12 of the court's judges, rather than a typical panel of three, and that one issue 

it wants to evaluate is whether it should "reconsider" its state street Bank ruling.
The Federal Circuit's action comes in the wake of a series of recent decisions by the 

supreme Court that has narrowed the scope of protections for patent holders. Last April, 

for example the justices signaled that too many patents were being upheld for "inventions" 

that are obvious. The judges on the Federal circuit are "reacting to the anti-patent trend 

at the Supreme Court", says Harold C. Wegner, a patent attorney and professor at George 

Washington University Law School.
26.	Business-method patents have recently aroused concern because of
[A] their limited value to business
[B] their connection with asset allocation
[C] the possible restriction on their granting
[D] the controversy over their authorization
27.	Which of the following is true of the Bilski case?
[A] Its ruling complies with the court decisions
[B] It involves a very big business transaction
[C] It has been dismissed by the Federal Circuit
[D] It may change the legal practices in the U.S.
28.	The word "about-face" (Line 1, Para 3) most probably means
[A] loss of good will
[B] increase of hostility
[C] change of attitude
[D] enhancement of dignity
29.	We learn from the last two paragraphs that business-method patents
[A] are immune to legal challenges
[B] are often unnecessarily issued
[C] lower the esteem for patent holders
[D] increase the incidence of risks
30.	Which of the following would be the subject of the text?

[B] Protection for business-method patent holders
[C] A legal case regarding business-method patents
[D] A prevailing trend against business-method patents
Text 3
In his book The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell argues that social epidemics are driven in 

large part by the acting of a tiny minority of special individuals, often called 

influentials, who are unusually informed, persuasive, or well-connected. The idea is 

intuitively compelling, but it doesn't explain how ideas actually spread.
The supposed importance of influentials derives from a plausible sounding but largely 

untested theory called the "two step flow of communication": Information flows from the 

media to the influentials and from them to everyone else. Marketers have embraced the 

two-step flow because it suggests that if they can just find and influence the 

influentials, those selected people will do most of the work for them. The theory also 

seems to explain the sudden and unexpected popularity of certain looks, brands, or 

neighborhoods. In many such cases, a cursory search for causes finds that some small group 

of people was wearing, promoting, or developing whatever it is before anyone else paid 

attention. Anecdotal evidence of this kind fits nicely with the idea that only certain 

special people can drive trends
In their recent work, however, some researchers have come up with the finding that 

influentials have far less impact on social epidemics than is generally supposed. In fact, 

they don't seem to be required of all.
The researchers' argument stems from a simple observing about social influence, with the 

exception of a few celebrities like Oprah Winfrey¡ªwhose outsize presence is primarily a 

function of media, not interpersonal, influence¡ªeven the most influential members of a 

population simply don't interact with that many others. Yet it is precisely these non-

celebrity influentials who, according to the two-step-flow theory, are supposed to drive 

social epidemics by influencing their friends and colleagues directly. For a social 

epidemic to occur, however, each person so affected, must then influence his or her own 

acquaintances, who must in turn influence theirs, and so on; and just how many others pay 

attention to each of these people has little to do with the initial influential. If people 

in the network just two degrees removed from the initial influential prove resistant, for 

example, the cascade of change won't propagate very far or affect many people.
Building on the basic truth about interpersonal influence, the researchers studied the 

dynamics of populations manipulating a number of variables relating of populations, 

manipulating a number of variables relating to people's ability to influence others and 

their tendency to be influenced. Our work shows that the principal requirement for what we 

call "global cascades" ¨C the widespread propagation of influence through networks ¨C is 

the presence not of a few influentials but, rather, of a critical mass of easily 

influenced people.
31.	By citing the book The Tipping Point, the author intends to
[A] analyze the consequences of social epidemics
[B] discuss influentials' function in spreading ideas
[C] exemplify people's intuitive response to social epidemics
[D] describe the essential characteristics of influentials.
32.	The author suggests that the "two-step-flow theory"
[A] serves as a solution to marketing problems
[B] has helped explain certain prevalent trends
[C] has won support from influentials
[D] requires solid evidence for its validity
33.	What the researchers have observed recently shows that
[A] the power of influence goes with social interactions
[B] interpersonal links can be enhanced through the media
[C] influentials have more channels to reach the public
[D] most celebrities enjoy wide media attention
34.	The underlined phrase "these people" in paragraph 4 refers to the ones who
[A] stay outside the network of social influence
[B] have little contact with the source of influence
[C] are influenced and then influence others
[D] are influenced by the initial influential
35.	what is the essential element in the dynamics of social influence?
[A] The eagerness to be accepted
[B] The impulse to influence others
[C] The readiness to be influenced
[D] The inclination to rely on others
Text 4
Bankers have been blaming themselves for their troubles in public. Behind the scenes, they 

have been taking aim at someone else: the accounting standard-setters. Their rules, moan 

the banks, have forced them to report enormous losses, and it's just not fair. These rules 

say they must value some assets at the price a third party would pay, not the price 

managers and regulators would like them to fetch.
Unfortunately, banks' lobbying now seems to be working. The details may be unknowable, but 

the independence of standard-setters, essential to the proper functioning of capital 

markets, is being compromised. And, unless banks carry toxic assets at prices that attract 

buyers, reviving the banking system will be difficult.
After a bruising encounter with Congress, America's Financial Accounting Standards Board 

(FASB) rushed through rule changes. These gave banks more freedom to use models to value 

illiquid assets and more flexibility in recognizing losses on long-term assets in their 

income statement. Bob Herz, the FASB's chairman, cried out against those who "question our 

motives." Yet bank shares rose and the changes enhance what one lobby group politely calls 

"the use of judgment by management."
European ministers instantly demanded that the International Accounting Standards Board 

(IASB) do likewise. The IASB says it does not want to act without overall planning, but 

the pressure to fold when it completes it reconstruction of rules later this year is 

strong. Charlie McCreevy, a European commissioner, warned the IASB that it did "not live 

in a political vacuum" but "in the real word" and that Europe could yet develop different 

rules.
It was banks that were on the wrong planet, with accounts that vastly overvalued assets. 

Today they argue that market prices overstate losses, because they largely reflect the 

temporary illiquidity of markets, not the likely extent of bad debts. The truth will not 

be known for years. But bank's shares trade below their book value, suggesting that 

investors are skeptical. And dead markets partly reflect the paralysis of banks which will 

not sell assets for fear of booking losses, yet are reluctant to buy all those supposed 

bargains.
To get the system working again, losses must be recognized and dealt with. America's new 

plan to buy up toxic assets will not work unless banks mark assets to levels which buyers 

find attractive. Successful markets require independent and even combative standard-

setters. The FASB and IASB have been exactly that, cleaning up rules on stock options and 

pensions, for example, against hostility from special interests. But by giving in to 

critics now they are inviting pressure to make more concessions.
36.	Bankers complained that they were forced to
[A] follow unfavorable asset evaluation rules
[B] collect payments from third parties
[C] cooperate with the price managers
[D] reevaluate some of their assets.
37.	According to the author , the rule changes of the FASB may result in
[A] the diminishing role of management
[B] the revival of the banking system
[C] the banks' long-term asset losses
[D] the weakening of its independence

[A] keep away from political influences.
[B] evade the pressure from their peers.
[C] act on their own in rule-setting.
[D] take gradual measures in reform.
39.	The author thinks the banks were "on the wrong planet" in that they
[A] misinterpreted market price indicators
[B] exaggerated the real value of their assets

[A] The first and more important is the consumer's growing preference for eating out; the 

consumption of food and drink in places other than homes has risen from about 32 percent 

of total consumption in 1995 to 35 percent in 2000 and is expected to approach 38 percent 

by 2005. This development is boosting wholesale demand from the food service segment by 4 

to 5 percent a year across Europe, compared with growth in retail demand of 1 to 2 

percent. Meanwhile, as the recession is looming large, people are getting anxious. They 

tend to keep a tighter hold on their purse and consider eating at home a realistic 

alternative.
[B] Retail sales of food and drink in Europe's largest markets are at a standstill, 

leaving European grocery retailers hungry for opportunities to grow. Most leading 

retailers have already tried e-commerce, with limited success, and expansion abroad. But 

almost all have ignored the big, profitable opportunity in their own backyard: the 

wholesale food and drink trade, which appears to be just the kind of market retailers 

need.
[C] Will such variations bring about a change in the overall structure of the food and 

drink market? Definitely not. The functioning of the market is based on flexible trends 

dominated by potential buyers. In other words, it is up to the buyer, rather than the 

seller, to decide what to buy .At any rate, this change will ultimately be acclaimed by an 

ever-growing number of both domestic and international consumers, regardless of how long 

the current consumer pattern will take hold.
[D] All in all, this clearly seems to be a market in which big retailers could profitably 

apply their scale, existing infrastructure and proven skills in the management of product 

ranges, logistics, and marketing intelligence. Retailers that master the intricacies of 

wholesaling in Europe may well expect to rake in substantial profits thereby. At least, 

that is how it looks as a whole. Closer inspection reveals important differences among the 

biggest national markets, especially in their customer segments and wholesale structures, 

as well as the competitive dynamics of individual food and drink categories. Big retailers 

must understand these differences before they can identify the segments of European 

wholesaling in which their particular abilities might unseat smaller but entrenched 

competitors. New skills and unfamiliar business models are needed too.
[E] Despite variations in detail, wholesale markets in the countries that have been 

closely examined¡ªFrance, Germany, Italy, and Spain¡ªare made out of the same building 

blocks. Demand comes mainly from two sources: independent mom-and-pop grocery stores 

which, unlike large retail chains, are too small to buy straight from producers, and food 

service operators that cater to consumers when they don't eat at home. Such food service 

operators range from snack machines to large institutional catering ventures, but most of 

these businesses are known in the trade as "horeca": hotels, restaurants, and cafes. 

Overall, Europe's wholesale market for food and drink is growing at the same sluggish pace 

as the retail market, but the figures, when added together, mask two opposing trends.
[F] For example, wholesale food and drink sales come to $268 billion in France, Germany, 

Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom in 2000¡ªmore than 40 percent of retail sales. 

Moreover, average overall margins are higher in wholesale than in retail; wholesale demand 

from the food service sector is growing quickly as more Europeans eat out more often; and 

changes in the competitive dynamics of this fragmented industry are at last making it 

feasible for wholesalers to consolidate.
[G] However, none of these requirements should deter large retailers (and even some large 

good producers and existing wholesalers) from trying their hand, for those that master the 

intricacies of wholesaling in Europe stand to reap considerable gains.

One basic weakness in a conservation system based wholly on economic motives is that most 

members of the land community have no economic value. Yet these creatures are members of 

the biotic community and, if its stability depends on its integrity, they are entitled to 

continuance.
When one of these noneconomic categories is threatened and, if we happen to love it .We 

invert excuses to give it economic importance. At the beginning of century songbirds were 

supposed to be disappearing. (46) Scientists jumped to the rescue with some distinctly 

shaky evidence to the effect that insects would eat us up if birds failed to control them. 

the evidence had to be economic in order to be valid.
It is painful to read these round about accounts today. We have no land ethic yet, (47) 

but we have at least drawn near the point of admitting that birds should continue as a 

matter of intrinsic right, regardless of the presence or absence of economic advantage to 

us.
A parallel situation exists in respect of predatory mammals and fish-eating birds. (48) 

Time was when biologists somewhat over worded the evidence that these creatures preserve 

the health of game by killing the physically weak, or that they prey only on "worthless" 

species.
Some species of tree have been read out of the party by economics-minded foresters because 

they grow too slowly, or have too low a sale vale to pay as timber crops. (49) In Europe, 

where forestry is ecologically more advanced, the non-commercial tree species are 

recognized as members of native forest community, to be preserved as such, within reason.
To sum up: a system of conservation based solely on economic self-interest is hopelessly 

lopsided. (50) It tends to ignore, and thus eventually to eliminate, many elements in the 

land community that lack commercial value, but that are essential to its healthy 

functioning. It assumes, falsely, I think, that the economic parts of the biotic clock 

will function without the uneconomic parts.

The enlightening picture portrays that a hot pot, with numerous ingredients in it, 

includes such domestic and alien cultures as literature, moral values and performing arts. 

It seems that the hot pot tastes very delicious because of the rich nutrition of the 

multi-cultures¡£
Obviously, the picture characterizes the status quo of Chinese society in which Chinese 

and Western culture conflict with each other but also merge into a unique form to a 

certain degree. Since China has opened its door widely to the outside world, many people 

from different countries have been deeply fascinated by Chinese culture. They will accept 

and love the Chinese culture as a whole. In addition, Chinese culture should be well 

shared with foreign people, who have shown their enthusiasm towards China. Meanwhile, the 

Chinese people are also exposed to foreign cultures when more foreign people come to this

lives. This suggests that  3 bulbs burn longer, that there is an  4  in not being too

Intelligence, it  5  out, is a high-priced option. It takes more upkeep, burns more fuel 

and is slow  6  the starting line because it depends on learning ¡ª a gradual  7  ¡ª 

instead of instinct. Plenty of other species are able to learn, and one of the things

research. I like it. Instead of casting a wistful glance 10  at all the species we've 

left in the dust I.Q.-wise, it implicitly asks what the real 11 of our own intelligence

Habits are a funny thing. We reach for them mindlessly, setting our brains on auto-pilot 

and relaxing into the unconscious comfort of familiar routine. "Not choice, but habit 

rules the unreflecting herd," William Wordsworth said in the 19th century. In the ever-

changing 21st century, even the word "habit" carries a negative implication.
So it seems paradoxical to talk about habits in the same context as creativity and 

innovation. But brain researchers have discovered that when we consciously develop new 

habits, we create parallel paths, and even entirely new brain cells, that can jump our 

trains of thought onto new, innovative tracks.
Rather than dismissing ourselves as unchangeable creatures of habit, we can instead direct 

our own change by consciously developing new habits. In fact, the more new things we try¡ª

the more we step outside our comfort zone¡ªthe more inherently creative we become, both in 

the workplace and in our personal lives.
But don't bother trying to kill off old habits; once those ruts of procedure are worn into 

the hippocampus, they're there to stay. Instead, the new habits we deliberately ingrain 

into ourselves create parallel pathways that can bypass those old roads.
"The first thing needed for innovation is a fascination with wonder," says Dawna Markova, 

author of "The Open Mind" and an executive change consultant for Professional Thinking 

Partners. "But we are taught instead to 'decide,' just as our president calls himself 'the 

Decider.' " She adds, however, that "to decide is to kill off all possibilities but one. A 

good innovational thinker is always exploring the many other possibilities."
All of us work through problems in ways of which we're unaware, she says. Researchers in 

the late 1960s discovered that humans are born with the capacity to approach challenges in 

four primary ways: analytically, procedurally, relationally (or collaboratively) and 

innovatively. At the end of adolescence, however, the brain shuts down half of that 

capacity, preserving only those modes of thought that have seemed most valuable during the 

first decade or so of life.
The current emphasis on standardized testing highlights analysis and procedure, meaning 

that few of us inherently use our innovative and collaborative modes of thought. "This 

breaks the major rule in the American belief system ¡ª that anyone can do anything," 

explains M. J. Ryan, author of the 2006 book This Year I Will... and Ms. Markova's 

business partner. "That's a lie that we have perpetuated, and it fosters commonness. 

Knowing what you're good at and doing even more of it creates excellence." This is where 

developing new habits comes in.

It is a wise father that knows his own child, but today a man can boost his paternal 

(fatherly) wisdom ¨C or at least confirm that he's the kid's dad. All he needs to do is 

shell our $30 for paternity testing kit (PTK) at his local drugstore ¨C and another $120 

to get the results.
More than 60,000 people have purchased the PTKs since they first become available without 

prescriptions last years, according to Doug Fog, chief operating officer of Identigene, 

which makes the over-the-counter kits. More than two dozen companies sell DNA tests 

Directly to the public , ranging in price from a few hundred dollars to more than $2,500.
Among the most popular: paternity and kinship testing , which adopted children can use to 

find their biological relatives and families can use to track down kids put up for 

adoption. DNA testing is also the latest rage among passionate genealogists¡ªand supports 

businesses that offer to search for a family's geographic roots .
Most tests require collecting cells by swabbing saliva in the mouth and sending it to the 

company for testing.  All tests require a potential candidate with whom to compare DNA.
But some observers are skeptical, "There is a kind of false precision being hawked by 

people claiming they are doing ancestry testing," says Trey Duster, a New York University 

sociologist. He notes that each individual has many ancestors-numbering in the hundreds 

just a few centuries back. Yet most ancestry testing only considers a single lineage, 

either the Y chromosome inherited through men in a father's line or mitochondrial DNA, 

which is passed down only from mothers. This DNA can reveal genetic information about only 

one or two ancestors, even though, for example, just three generations back people also 

have six other great-grandparents or, four generations back, 14 other great-great-

grandparents.
Critics also argue that commercial genetic testing is only as good as the reference 

collections to which a sample is compared. Databases used by some companies don't rely on 

data collected systematically but rather lump together information from different research 

projects. This means that a DNA database may have a lot of data from some regions and not 

others, so a person¡¯s test results may differ depending on the company that processes the 

results. In addition, the computer programs a company uses to estimate relationships may 

be patented and not subject to peer review or outside evaluation.

The relationship between formal education and economic growth in poor countries is widely 

misunderstood by economists and politicians alike. Progress in both area is undoubtedly 

necessary for the social, political and intellectual development of these and all other 

societies; however, the conventional view that education should be one of the very highest 

priorities for promoting rapid economic development in poor countries is wrong. We are 

fortunate that is it, because building new educational systems there and putting enough 

people through them to improve economic performance would require two or three 

generations. The findings of a research institution have consistently shown that workers 

in all countries can be trained on the job to achieve radically higher productivity and, 

as a result, radically higher standards of living.
Ironically, the first evidence for this idea appeared in the United States. Not long ago, 

with the country entering a recessing and Japan at its pre-bubble peak. The U.S. workforce 

was derided as poorly educated and one of the primary cause of the poor U.S. economic 

performance. Japan was, and remains, the global leader in automotive-assembly 

productivity. Yet the research revealed that the U.S. factories of Honda, Nissan, and 

Toyota achieved about 95 percent of the productivity of their Japanese counterparts -- a 

result of the training that U.S. workers received on the job.
More recently, while examining housing construction, the researchers discovered that 

illiterate, non-English- speaking Mexican workers in Houston, Texas, consistently met 

best-practice labor productivity standards despite the complexity of the building 

industry's work.
What is the real relationship between education and economic development? We have to 

suspect that continuing economic growth promotes the development of education even when 

governments don't force it. After all, that's how education got started. When our 

ancestors were hunters and gatherers 10,000 years ago, they didn't have time to wonder 

much about anything besides finding food. Only when humanity began to get its food in a 

more productive way was there time for other things.
As education improved, humanity's productivity potential increased as well. When the 

competitive environment pushed our ancestors to achieve that potential, they could in turn 

afford more education. This increasingly high level of education is probably a necessary, 

but not a sufficient, condition for the complex political systems required by advanced 

economic performance. Thus poor countries might not be able to escape their poverty traps 

without political changes that may be possible only with broader formal education. A lack 

of formal education, however, doesn't constrain the ability of the developing world's 

workforce to substantially improve productivity for the foreseeable future. On the 

contrary, constraints on improving productivity explain why education isn't developing 

more quickly there than it is.
31.	The author holds in paragraph 1 that the important of education in poor countries  

___________.
[A] is subject groundless doubts
[B] has fallen victim of bias
[C] is conventional downgraded
[D] has been overestimated
32.	It is stated in Paragraph 1 that construction of a new education system  

__________.
[A] challenges economists and politicians
[B] takes efforts of generations
[C] demands priority from the government
[D] requires sufficient labor force
33.	A major difference between the Japanese and U.S workforces is that __________.
[A] the Japanese workforce is better disciplined
[B] the Japanese workforce is more productive
[C] the U.S workforce has a better education
[D] the U.S workforce is more organize
34.	The author quotes the example of our ancestors to show that education emerged 

__________.
[A] when people had enough time
[B] prior to better ways of finding food
[C] when people on longer went hung
[D] as a result of pressure on government
35.	According to the last paragraph , development of education __________.
[A] results directly from competitive environments
[B] does not depend on economic performance
[C] follows improved productivity
[D] cannot afford political changes
Text 4
The most thoroughly studied intellectuals in the history of the New World are the 

ministers and political leaders of seventeenth-century New England. According to the 

standard history of American philosophy, nowhere else in colonial America was "So much 

importance attached to intellectual pursuits. " According to many books and articles, New 

England's leaders established the basic themes and preoccupations of an unfolding, 

dominant Puritan tradition in American intellectual life.
To take this approach to the New Englanders normally means to start with the Puritans' 

theological innovations and their distinctive ideas about the church-important subjects 

that we may not neglect. But in keeping with our examination of southern intellectual 

life, we may consider the original Puritans as carriers of European culture, adjusting to 

New World circumstances. The New England colonies were the scenes of important episodes in 

the pursuit of widely understood ideals of civility and virtuosity.
The early settlers of Massachusetts Bay included men of impressive education and influence 

in England. Besides the ninety or so learned ministers who came to Massachusetts church in 

the decade after 1629,There were political leaders like John Winthrop, an educated 

gentleman, lawyer, and official of the Crown before he journeyed to Boston. There men 

wrote and published extensively, reaching both New World and Old World audiences, and 

giving New England an atmosphere of intellectual earnestness.
We should not forget , however, that most New Englanders were less well educated. While 

few craftsmen or farmers, let alone dependents and servants, left literary compositions to 

be analyzed, it is obvious that their views were less fully intellectualized. Their 

thinking often had a traditional superstitions quality. A tailor named John Dane, who 

emigrated in the late 1630s, left an account of his reasons for leaving England that is 

filled with signs. Sexual confusion, economic frustrations , and religious hope¡ªall came 

together in a decisive moment when he opened the Bible, told his father the first line he 

saw would settle his fate, and read the magical words: "come out from among them, touch no 

unclean thing , and I will be your God and you shall be my people." One wonders what Dane 

thought of the careful sermons explaining the Bible that he heard in puritan churches.
Meanwhile, many settles had slighter religious commitments than Dane's, as one clergyman 

learned in confronting folk along the coast who mocked that they had not come to the New 

world for religion . "Our main end was to catch fish. "
36.	The author notes that in the seventeenth-century New England___________.
[A] Puritan tradition dominated political life.
[B] intellectual interests were encouraged.
[C] Politics benefited much from intellectual endeavors.
[D] intellectual pursuits enjoyed a liberal environment.
37.	It is suggested in paragraph 2 that New Englanders__________.
[A] experienced a comparatively peaceful early history.
[B] brought with them the culture of the Old World
[C] paid little attention to southern intellectual life
[D] were obsessed with religious innovations
38.	The early ministers and political leaders in Massachusetts Bay__________.
[A] were famous in the New World for their writings
[B] gained increasing importance in religious affairs
[C] abandoned high positions before coming to the New World
[D] created a new intellectual atmosphere in New England
39.	The story of John Dane shows that less well-educated New Englanders were often 

__________.
[A] influenced by superstitions
[B] troubled with religious beliefs
[C] puzzled by church sermons
[D] frustrated with family earnings
40.	The text suggests that early settlers in New England__________.
[A] were mostly engaged in political activities
[B] were motivated by an illusory prospect
[C] came from different backgrounds.
[D] left few formal records for later reference

Coinciding with the groundbreaking theory of biological evolution proposed by British 

naturalist Charles Darwin in the 1860s, British social philosopher Herbert Spencer put 

forward his own theory of biological and cultural evolution. Spencer argued that all 

worldly phenomena, including human societies, changed over time, advancing toward 

perfection. 41.____________.
American social scientist Lewis Henry Morgan introduced another theory of cultural 

evolution in the late 1800s. Morgan, along with Tylor, was one of the founders of modern 

anthropology. In his work, he attempted to show how all aspects of culture changed 

together in the evolution of societies.42._____________.
In the early 1900s in North America, German-born American anthropologist Franz Boas 

developed a new theory of culture known as historical particularism. Historical 

particularism, which emphasized the uniqueness of all cultures, gave new direction to 

anthropology. 43._____________.
Boas felt that the culture of any society must be understood as the result of a unique 

history and not as one of many cultures belonging to a broader evolutionary stage or type 

of culture. 44._______________.
Historical particularism became a dominant approach to the study of culture in American 

anthropology, largely through the influence of many students of Boas. But a number of 

anthropologists in the early 1900s also rejected the particularist theory of culture in 

favor of diffusionism. Some attributed virtually every important cultural achievement to 

the inventions of a few, especially gifted peoples that, according to diffusionists, then 

spread to other cultures. 45.________________.
Also in the early 1900s, French sociologist ¨¦mile Durkheim developed a theory of culture 

that would greatly influence anthropology. Durkheim proposed that religious beliefs 

functioned to reinforce social solidarity. An interest in the relationship between the 

function of society and culture¡ªknown as functionalism¡ªbecame a major theme in European, 

and especially British, anthropology.
[A]	Other anthropologists believed that cultural innovations, such as inventions, had 

a single origin and passed from society to society. This theory was known as diffusionism.
[B]	In order to study particular cultures as completely as possible, Boas became 

skilled in linguistics, the study of languages, and in physical anthropology, the study of 

human biology and anatomy.
[C]	He argued that human evolution was characterized by a struggle he called the 

"survival of the fittest," in which weaker races and societies must eventually be replaced 

by stronger, more advanced races and societies.
[D]	They also focused on important rituals that appeared to preserve a people's social 

structure, such as initiation ceremonies that formally signify children's entrance into 

adulthood.
[E]	Thus, in his view, diverse aspects of culture, such as the structure of families, 

forms of marriage, categories of kinship, ownership of property, forms of government, 

technology, and systems of food production, all changed as societies evolved.
[F]	Supporters of the theory viewed as a collection of integrated parts that work 

together to keep a society functioning.
[G]	For example, British anthropologists Grafton Elliot Smith and W. J. Perry 

incorrectly suggested, on the basis of inadequate information, that farming, pottery 

making, and metallurgy all originated in ancient Egypt and diffused throughout the world. 

In fact, all of these cultural developments occurred separately at different times in many 

parts of the world.

There is a marked difference between the education which everyone gets from living with 

others, and the deliberate educating of the young. In the former case the education is 

incidental; it is natural and important, but it is not the express reason of the 

association. (46) It may be said that the measure of the worth of any social institution 

is its effect in enlarging and improving experience; but this effect is not a part of its 

original motive. Religious associations began, for example, in the desire to secure the 

favor of overruling powers and to ward off evil influences; family life in the desire to 

gratify appetites and secure family perpetuity; systematic labor, for the most part, 

because of enslavement to others, etc. (47) Only gradually was the by-product of the 

institution noted, and only more gradually still was this effect considered as a directive 

factor in the conduct of the institution. Even today, in our industrial life, apart from 

certain values of industriousness and thrift, the intellectual and emotional reaction of 

the forms of human association under which the world's work is carried on receives little 

attention as compared with physical output.
But in dealing with the young, the fact of association itself as an immediate human fact, 

gains in importance. (48) While it is easy to ignore in our contact with them the effect 

of our acts upon their disposition, it is not so easy as in dealing with adults. The need 

of training is too evident; the pressure to accomplish a change in their attitude and 

habits is too urgent to leave these consequences wholly out of account. (49) Since our 

chief business with them is to enable them to share in a common life we cannot help 

considering whether or no we are forming the powers which will secure this ability.If 

humanity has made some headway in realizing that the ultimate value of every institution 

is its distinctively human effect we may well believe that this lesson has been learned 

largely through dealings with the young.
(50) We are thus led to distinguish, within the broad educational process which we have 

been so far considering, a more formal kind of education -- that of direct tuition or 

schooling. In undeveloped social groups, we find very little formal teaching and training. 

These groups mainly rely for instilling needed dispositions into the young upon the same 

sort of association which keeps the adults loyal to their group.

    As we can see in the picture, many people, old or young, men or women, are in front of 

a computer and using the Internet in the space just like a huge web of a spider. The 

caption in the drawing reads: ¡°the Internet: near or far ¡±. 
It is obvious that the huge spider web is the symbol of the Internet and the symbolic 

meaning of the picture is the effect of the Internet 
on people¡¯s way of life. There is no doubt that the 
Internet provides us with considerable convenience. Internet is revolutionizing our way of 

living, making many things possible which are beyond our dreams. As a communication tool, 

the Internet makes us closer than ever before by providing immediate communication via e-

mail, QQ, MSN or 
ICQ, no matter how far away our friends are. So in this sense, the Internet is making us 

nearer to each other. 
  However, there are negative effects of the Internet on people¡¯s life. 
As is shown in the picture, people are imprisoned in their own respective small cabins, 

indulging in their own world. They choose contacting online rather than communicating face 

to face. Due to the addiction to the fictional world, people seem to have forgotten the 

traditional and most efficient communication method, and thus indifference has become a 

not uncommon phenomenon in the modern world. We often hear parents complain that they have 

less and less time chatting with their children either because their children spend too 

much time playing games or chatting online with friends or 
strangers. Also there are couples who seldom talk with each other. Therefore, Internet 

seems to make near people far away. 
  Hence, how to use modern communication tools such as Internet properly has becomes a hot 

issue in recent years. While we are enjoying the convenience provided by the Internet, we 

should also bear in mind that human beings are social beings who need real interpersonal 

interactions. 
Joint efforts are needed to ensure enough time for people especially families to have 

face-to-face 
communication with each other. Only in this way can we expect a healthy development of the 
relationship among individuals.

The idea that some groups of people may be more intelligent than others is one of those 

hypotheses that dare not speak its name. But Gregory Cochran is  1  to say it anyway. He 

is that  2  bird, a scientist who works independently  3  any institution. He helped 

popularize the idea that some diseases not  4  thought to have a bacterial cause were 

actually infections, which aroused much controversy when it was first suggested.
 5  he, however, might tremble at the  6  of what he is about to do. Together with 

another two scientists, he is publishing a paper which not only  7  that one group of 

humanity is more intelligent than the others, but explains the process that has brought 

this about. The group in  8  are a particular people originated from central Europe. The 

process is natural selection.
This group generally do well in IQ test,  9  12-15 points above the  10  value of 100, 

and have contributed  11  to the intellectual and cultural life of the West, as the  12

  of their elites, including several world-renowned scientists,  13 . They also suffer 

more often than most people from a number of nasty genetic diseases, such as breast 

cancer. These facts,  14 , have previously been thought unrelated. The former has been 

 15  to social effects, such as a strong tradition of  16  education. The latter was 

seen as a (an)  17  of genetic isolation. Dr. Cochran suggests that the intelligence and 

diseases are intimately  18 . His argument is that the unusual history of these people 

has  19  them to unique evolutionary pressures that have resulted in this  20  state of 

affairs.

While still catching up to men in some spheres of modern life, women appear to be way 

ahead in at least one undesirable category. ¡°Women are particularly susceptible to 

developing depression and anxiety disorders in response to stress compared to men,¡± 

according to Dr. Yehuda, chief psychiatrist at New York¡¯s Veteran¡¯s Administration 

Hospital.
Studies of both animals and humans have shown that sex hormones somehow affect the stress 

response, causing females under stress to produce more of the trigger chemicals than do 

males under the same conditions. In several of the studies, when stressed-out female rats 

had their ovaries (the female reproductive organs) removed, their chemical responses 

became equal to those of the males.
Adding to a woman¡¯s increased dose of stress chemicals, are her increased ¡°opportunities

¡± for stress. ¡°It¡¯s not necessarily that women don¡¯t cope as well. It¡¯s just that they 

have so much more to cope with,¡± says Dr. Yehuda. ¡°Their capacity for tolerating stress 

may even be greater than men¡¯s,¡± she observes, ¡°it¡¯s just that they¡¯re dealing with so 

many more things that they become worn out from it more visibly and sooner.¡±
Dr. Yehuda notes another difference between the sexes. ¡°I think that the kinds of things 

that women are exposed to tend to be in more of a chronic or repeated nature. Men go to 

war and are exposed to combat stress. Men are exposed to more acts of random physical 

violence. The kinds of interpersonal violence that women are exposed to tend to be in 

domestic situations, by, unfortunately, parents or other family members, and they tend not 

to be one-shot deals. The wear-and-tear that comes from these longer relationships can be 

quite devastating.¡±
Adeline Alvarez married at 18 and gave birth to a son, but was determined to finish 

college. ¡°I struggled a lot to get the college degree. I was living in so much 

frustration that that was my escape, to go to school, and get ahead and do better.¡± 

Later, her marriage ended and she became a single mother. ¡°It¡¯s the hardest thing to 

take care of a teenager, have a job, pay the rent, pay the car payment, and pay the debt. 

I lived from paycheck to paycheck.¡±
Not everyone experiences the kinds of severe chronic stresses Alvarez describes. But most 

women today are coping with a lot of obligations, with few breaks, and feeling the strain. 

Alvarez¡¯s experience demonstrates the importance of finding ways to diffuse stress before 

it threatens your health and your ability to function.

It used to be so straightforward. A team of researchers working together in the laboratory 

would submit the results of their research to a journal. A journal editor would then 

remove the authors¡¯ names and affiliations from the paper and send it to their peers for 

review. Depending on the comments received, the editor would accept the paper for 

publication or decline it. Copyright rested with the journal publisher, and researchers 

seeking knowledge of the results would have to subscribe to the journal.
No longer. The Internet ¨C and pressure from funding agencies, who are questioning why 

commercial publishers are making money from government-funded research by restricting 

access to it ¨C is making access to scientific results a reality. The Organization for 

Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has just issued a report describing the far-

reaching consequences of this. The report, by John Houghton of Victoria University in 

Australia and Graham Vickery of the OECD, makes heavy reading for publishers who have, so 

far, made handsome profits. But it goes further than that. It signals a change in what 

has, until now, been a key element of scientific endeavor.
The value of knowledge and the return on the public investment in research depends, in 

part, upon wide distribution and ready access. It is big business. In America, the core 

scientific publishing market is estimated at between $7 billion and $11 billion. The 

International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers says that there 

are more than 2,000 publishers worldwide specializing in these subjects. They publish more 

than 1.2 million articles each year in some 16,000 journals.
This is now changing. According to the OECD report, some 75% of scholarly journals are now 

online. Entirely new business models are emerging; three main ones were identified by the 

report¡¯s authors. There is the so-called big deal, where institutional subscribers pay 

for access to a collection of online journal titles through site-licensing agreements. 

There is open-access publishing, typically supported by asking the author (or his 

employer) to pay for the paper to be published. Finally, there are open-access archives, 

where organizations such as universities or international laboratories support 

institutional repositories. Other models exist that are hybrids of these three, such as 

delayed open-access, where journals allow only subscribers to read a paper for the first 

six months, before making it freely available to everyone who wishes to see it. All this 

could change the traditional form of the peer-review process, at least for the publication 

of papers.
26.	In the first paragraph, the author discusses
[A] the background information of journal editing.
[B] the publication routine of laboratory reports.
[C] the relations of authors with journal publishers.
[D] the traditional process of journal publication.
27.	Which of the following is true of the OECD report?
[A] It criticizes government-funded research.
[B] It introduces an effective means of publication.
[C] It upsets profit-making journal publishers.
[D] It benefits scientific research considerably.
28.	According to the text, online publication is significant in that
[A] it provides an easier access to scientific results.
[B] it brings huge profits to scientific researchers.
[C] it emphasizes the crucial role of scientific knowledge.
[D] it facilitates public investment in scientific research.
29.	With the open-access publishing model, the author of a paper is required to
[A] cover the cost of its publication.
[B] subscribe to the journal publishing it.
[C] allow other online journals to use it freely.
[D] complete the peer-review before submission.
30.	Which of the following best summarizes the text?
[A] The Internet is posing a threat to publishers.
[B] A new mode of publication is emerging.
[C] Authors welcome the new channel for publication.
[D] Publication is rendered easier by online service.
Text 3
In the early 1960s Wilt Chamberlain was one of only three players in the National 

Basketball Association (NBA) listed at over seven feet. If he had played last season, 

however, he would have been one of 42. The bodies playing major professional sports have 

changed dramatically over the years, and managers have been more than willing to adjust 

team uniforms to fit the growing numbers of bigger, longer frames.
The trend in sports, though, may be obscuring an unrecognized reality: Americans have 

generally stopped growing. Though typically about two inches taller now than 140 years 

ago, today¡¯s people ¨C especially those born to families who have lived in the U.S. for 

many generations ¨C apparently reached their limit in the early 1960s. And they aren¡¯t 

likely to get any taller. ¡°In the general population today, at this genetic, 

environmental level, we¡¯ve pretty much gone as far as we can go,¡± says anthropologist 

William Cameron Chumlea of Wright State University. In the case of NBA players, their 

increase in height appears to result from the increasingly common practice of recruiting 

players from all over the world.
Growth, which rarely continues beyond the age of 20, demands calories and nutrients ¨C 

notably, protein ¨C to feed expanding tissues. At the start of the 20th century, under-

nutrition and childhood infections got in the way. But as diet and health improved, 

children and adolescents have, on average, increased in height by about an inch and a half 

every 20 years, a pattern known as the secular trend in height. Yet according to the 

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, average height ¨C 5¡ä9¡å for men, 5¡ä4¡å for 

women ¨C hasn¡¯t really changed since 1960.
Genetically speaking, there are advantages to avoiding substantial height. During 

childbirth, larger babies have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. Moreover, 

even though humans have been upright for millions of years, our feet and back continue to 

struggle with bipedal posture and cannot easily withstand repeated strain imposed by 

oversize limbs. ¡°There are some real constraints that are set by the genetic architecture 

of the individual organism,¡± says anthropologist William Leonard of Northwestern 

University.
Genetic maximums can change, but don¡¯t expect this to happen soon. Claire C. Gordon, 

senior anthropologist at the Army Research Center in Natick, Mass., ensures that 90 

percent of the uniforms and workstations fit recruits without alteration. She says that, 

unlike those for basketball, the length of military uniforms has not changed for some 

time. And if you need to predict human height in the near future to design a piece of 

equipment, Gordon says that by and large, ¡°you could use today¡¯s data and feel fairly 

confident.¡±
31.	Wilt Chamberlain is cited as an example to
[A] illustrate the change of height of NBA players.
[B] show the popularity of NBA players in the U.S..
[C] compare different generations of NBA players.
[D] assess the achievements of famous NBA players.
32.	Which of the following plays a key role in body growth according to the text?
[A] Genetic modification.
[B] Natural environment.

33.	On which of the following statements would the author most probably agree?
[A] Non-Americans add to the average height of the nation.
[B] Human height is conditioned by the upright posture.

[B] the design of military uniforms will remain unchanged.
[C] genetic testing will be employed in selecting sportsmen.
[D] the existing data of human height will still be applicable.

In 1784, five years before he became president of the United States, George Washington, 

52, was nearly toothless. So he hired a dentist to transplant nine teeth into his jaw ¨C 

having extracted them from the mouths of his slaves.
That¡¯s a far different image from the cherry-tree-chopping George most people remember 

from their history books. But recently, many historians have begun to focus on the roles 

slavery played in the lives of the founding generation. They have been spurred in part by 

DNA evidence made available in 1998, which almost certainly proved Thomas Jefferson had 

fathered at least one child with his slave Sally Hemings. And only over the past 30 years 

have scholars examined history from the bottom up. Works of several historians reveal the 

moral compromises made by the nation¡¯s early leaders and the fragile nature of the 

country¡¯s infancy. More significantly, they argue that many of the Founding Fathers knew 

slavery was wrong ¨C and yet most did little to fight it.
More than anything, the historians say, the founders were hampered by the culture of their 

time. While Washington and Jefferson privately expressed distaste for slavery, they also 

understood that it was part of the political and economic bedrock of the country they 

helped to create.
For one thing, the South could not afford to part with its slaves. Owning slaves was 

¡°like having a large bank account,¡± says Wiencek, author of An Imperfect God: George 

Washington, His Slaves, and the Creation of America. The southern states would not have 

signed the Constitution without protections for the ¡°peculiar institution,¡± including a 

clause that counted a slave as three fifths of a man for purposes of congressional 

representation.
And the statesmen¡¯s political lives depended on slavery. The three-fifths formula handed 

Jefferson his narrow victory in the presidential election of 1800 by inflating the votes 

of the southern states in the Electoral College. Once in office, Jefferson extended 

slavery with the Louisiana Purchase in 1803; the new land was carved into 13 states, 

including three slave states.
Still, Jefferson freed Hemings¡¯s children ¨C though not Hemings herself or his 

approximately 150 other slaves. Washington, who had begun to believe that all men were 

created equal after observing the bravery of the black soldiers during the Revolutionary 

War, overcame the strong opposition of his relatives to grant his slaves their freedom in 

his will. Only a decade earlier, such an act would have required legislative approval in 

Virginia.
36.	George Washington¡¯s dental surgery is mentioned to
[A] show the primitive medical practice in the past.
[B] demonstrate the cruelty of slavery in his days.
[C] stress the role of slaves in the U.S. history.
[D] reveal some unknown aspect of his life.
37.	We may infer from the second paragraph that
[A] DNA technology has been widely applied to history research.
[B] in its early days the U.S. was confronted with delicate situations.
[C] historians deliberately made up some stories of Jefferson¡¯s life.
[D] political compromises are easily found throughout the U.S. history.
38.	What do we learn about Thomas Jefferson?
[A] His political view changed his attitude towards slavery.
[B] His status as a father made him free the child slaves.
[C] His attitude towards slavery was complex.
[D] His affair with a slave stained his prestige.
39.	Which of the following is true according to the text?
[A] Some Founding Fathers benefit politically from slavery.
[B] Slaves in the old days did not have the right to vote.
[C] Slave owners usually had large savings accounts.
[D] Slavery was regarded as a peculiar institution.

The time for sharpening pencils, arranging your desk, and doing almost anything else 

instead of writing has ended. The first draft will appear on the page only if you stop 

avoiding the inevitable and sit, stand up, or lie down to write. (41)ÊÇ  ÍøÔ­´´³öÆ·
Be flexible. Your outline should smoothly conduct you from one point to the next, but do 

not permit it to railroad you. If a relevant and important idea occurs to you now, work it 

into the draft. (42)ÊÇ  ÍøÔ­´´³öÆ· Grammar, punctuation, and spelling can wait until you 

revise. Concentrate on what you are saying. Good writing most often occurs when you are in 

hot pursuit of an idea rather than in a nervous search for errors.
(43)ÊÇ  ÍøÔ­´´³öÆ· Your pages will be easier to keep track of that way, and, if you have 

to clip a paragraph to place it elsewhere, you will not lose any writing on the other 

side.
If you are working on a word processor, you can take advantage of its capacity to make 

additions and deletions as well as move entire paragraphs by making just a few simple 

keyboard commands. Some software programs can also check spelling and certain grammatical 

elements in your writing. (44)ÊÇ  ÍøÔ­´´³öÆ· These printouts are also easier to read than 

the screen when you work on revisions.
Once you have a first draft on paper, you can delete material that is unrelated to your 

thesis and add material necessary to illustrate your points and make your paper 

convincing. The student who wrote ¡°The A & P as a State of Mind¡± wisely dropped a 

paragraph that questioned whether Sammy displays chauvinistic attitudes toward women. (45)

ÊÇ  ÍøÔ­´´³öÆ·
Remember that your initial draft is only that. You should go through the paper many times 

¨C and then again ¨C working to substantiate and clarify your ideas. You may even end up 

with several entire versions of the paper. Rewrite. The sentences within each paragraph 

should be related to a single topic. Transitions should connect one paragraph to the next 

so that there are no abrupt or confusing shifts. Awkward or wordy phrasing or unclear 

sentences and paragraphs should be mercilessly poked and prodded into shape.
[A]	To make revising easier, leave wide margins and extra space between lines so that 

you can easily add words, sentences, and corrections. Write on only one side of the paper.
[B]	After you have clearly and adequately developed the body of your paper, pay 

particular attention to the introductory and concluding paragraphs. It¡¯s probably best to 

write the introduction last, after you know precisely what you are introducing. Concluding 

paragraphs demand equal attention because they leave the reader with a final impression.
[C]	It¡¯s worth remembering, however, that though a clean copy fresh off a printer may 

look terrific, it will read only as well as the thinking and writing that have gone into 

it. Many writers prudently store their data on disks and print their pages each time they 

finish a draft to avoid losing any material because of power failures or other problems.
[D]	It makes no difference how you write, just so you do. Now that you have developed 

a topic into a tentative thesis, you can assemble your notes and begin to flesh out 

whatever outline you have made.
[E]	Although this is an interesting issue, it has nothing to do with the thesis, which 

explains how the setting influences Sammy¡¯s decision to quit his job. Instead of 

including that paragraph, she added one that described Lengel¡¯s crabbed response to the 

girls so that she could lead up to the A & P ¡°policy¡± he enforces.
[F]	In the final paragraph about the significance of the setting in ¡°A & P,¡± the 

student brings together the reasons Sammy quit his job by referring to his refusal to 

accept Lengel¡¯s store policies.
[G]	By using the first draft as a means of thinking about what you want to say, you 

will very likely discover more than your notes originally suggested. Plenty of good 

writers don¡¯t use outlines at all but discover ordering principles as they write. Do not 

attempt to compose a perfectly correct draft the first time around.

In his autobiography, Darwin himself speaks of his intellectual powers with extraordinary 

modesty. He points out that he always experienced much difficulty in expressing himself 

clearly and concisely, but (46) he believes that this very difficulty may have had the 

compensating advantage of forcing him to think long and intently about every sentence, and 

thus enabling him to detect errors in reasoning and in his own observations. He disclaimed 

the possession of any great quickness of apprehension or wit, such as distinguished 

Huxley. (47) He asserted, also, that his power to follow a long and purely abstract train 

of thought was very limited, for which reason he felt certain that he never could have 

succeeded with mathematics. His memory, too, he described as extensive, but hazy. So poor 

in one sense was it that he never could remember for more than a few days a single date or 

a line of poetry. (48) On the other hand, he did not accept as well founded the charge 

made by some of his critics that, while he was a good observer, he had no power of 

reasoning. This, he thought, could not be true, because the ¡°Origin of Species¡± is one 

long argument from the beginning to the end, and has convinced many able men. No one, he 

submits, could have written it without possessing some power of reasoning. He was willing 

to assert that ¡°I have a fair share of invention, and of common sense or judgment, such 

as every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any higher 

degree.¡± (49) He adds humbly that perhaps he was ¡°superior to the common run of men in 

noticing things which easily escape attention, and in observing them carefully.¡±
Writing in the last year of his life, he expressed the opinion that in two or three 

respects his mind had changed during the preceding twenty or thirty years. Up to the age 

of thirty or beyond it poetry of many kinds gave him great pleasure. Formerly, too, 

pictures had given him considerable, and music very great, delight. In 1881, however, he 

said: ¡°Now for many years I cannot endure to read a line of poetry. I have also almost 

lost my taste for pictures or music.¡± (50) Darwin was convinced that the loss of these 

tastes was not only a loss of happiness, but might possibly be injurious to the intellect, 

and more probably to the moral character.

As is illustrated in the picture, the two disabled persons whose crippled legs are bound 

together do a lot of traveling. Accordingly, this far-reaching picture reflects a common 

phenomenon in today¡¯s society: the people who are in the dark want to turn the corner but 

they can not make it respectively and in turn they have to choose to pull together in 

times of trouble.
There are several reasons accounting for this. Since we have to live in an on-the-move 

lifestyle, we may encounter various plights, where we would be at a loss rather than to 

seek for others¡¯ assistance. Further more, if we do not offer help to each other when we 

confront dilemma, we would not realize our dream. And no issue in China is as basic to 

build up the society in harmony as to conduct coordination in face of disasters.
Judging from what have been argued above, people have come to realize the value of mutual 

aid. It is, therefore, necessary that some effective steps be made to advocate spirit of 

supporting each other. To begin with, the government should make laws to encourage people 

to unite. In addition, people should enhance the awareness of caring each other especially 

when they are in trouble. Only in those ways, can we make people, even not being 

acquaintance, help each other.

By 1830 the former Spanish and Portuguese colonies had become independent nations. The 

roughly 20 million  1  of these nations looked  2  to the future. Born in the crisis of 

the old regime and Iberian Colonialism, many of the leaders of independence  3  the 

ideals of representative government, careers  4  to talent, freedom of commerce and 

trade, the  5  to private property, and a belief in the individual as the basis of 

society.  6  there was a belief that the new nations should be sovereign and independent 

states, large enough to be economically viable and integrated by a  7  set of laws.
On the issue of  8  of religion and the position of the church,  9 , there was less 

agreement  10  the leadership. Roman Catholicism had been the state religion and the 

only one  11  by the Spanish crown.  12  most leaders sought to maintain Catholicism  

13  the official religion of the new states, some sought to end the  14  of other 

faiths. The defense of the Church became a rallying  15  for the conservative forces.
The ideals of the early leaders of independence were often egalitarian, valuing equality 

of everything. Bolivar had received aid from Haiti and had  16  in return to abolish 

slavery in the areas he liberated. By 1854 slavery had been abolished everywhere except 

Spain¡¯s  17  colonies. Early promises to end Indian tribute and taxes on people of

policies  19 . Egalitarian sentiments were often tempered by fears that the mass of the 

population was  20  self-rule and democracy.

If you were to examine the birth certificates of every soccer player in 2006¡¯s World Cup 

tournament, you would most likely find a noteworthy quirk: elite soccer players are more 

likely to have been born in the earlier months of the year than in the later months. If 

you then examined the European national youth teams that feed the World Cup and 

professional ranks, you would find this strange phenomenon to be even more pronounced.
What might account for this strange phenomenon? Here are a few guesses: a) certain 

astrological signs confer superior soccer skills; b) winter-born babies tend to have 

higher oxygen capacity, which increases soccer stamina; c) soccer-mad parents are more 

likely to conceive children in springtime, at the annual peak of soccer mania; d) none of 

the above.
Anders Ericsson, a 58-year-old psychology professor at Florida State University, says he 

believes strongly in ¡°none of the above.¡± Ericsson grew up in Sweden, and studied 

nuclear engineering until he realized he would have more opportunity to conduct his own 

research if he switched to psychology. His first experiment, nearly 30 years ago, involved 

memory: training a person to hear and then repeat a random series of numbers. ¡°With the 

first subject, after about 20 hours of training, his digit span had risen from 7 to 20,¡± 

Ericsson recalls. ¡°He kept improving, and after about 200 hours of training he had risen 

to over 80 numbers.¡±
This success, coupled with later research showing that memory itself is not genetically 

determined, led Ericsson to conclude that the act of memorizing is more of a cognitive 

exercise than an intuitive one. In other words, whatever inborn differences two people may 

exhibit in their abilities to memorize, those differences are swamped by how well each 

person ¡°encodes¡± the information. And the best way to learn how to encode information 

meaningfully, Ericsson determined, was a process known as deliberate practice. Deliberate 

practice entails more than simply repeating a task. Rather, it involves setting specific 

goals, obtaining immediate feedback and concentrating as much on technique as on outcome.
Ericsson and his colleagues have thus taken to studying expert performers in a wide range 

of pursuits, including soccer. They gather all the data they can, not just performance 

statistics and biographical details but also the results of their own laboratory 

experiments with high achievers. Their work makes a rather startling assertion: the trait 

we commonly call talent is highly overrated. Or, put another way, expert performers ¨C 

whether in memory or surgery, ballet or computer programming ¨C are nearly always made, 

not born.
21.	The birthday phenomenon found among soccer players is mentioned to
[A] stress the importance of professional training.
[B] spotlight the soccer superstars in the World Cup.
[C] introduce the topic of what makes expert performance.
[D] explain why some soccer teams play better than others.
22.	The word ¡°mania¡± (Line 4, Paragraph 2) most probably means
[A] fun.
[B] craze.
[C] hysteria.
[D] excitement.
23.	According to Ericsson, good memory
[A] depends on meaningful processing of information.
[B] results from intuitive rather than cognitive exercises.
[C] is determined by genetic rather than psychological factors.
[D] requires immediate feedback and a high degree of concentration.
24.	Ericsson and his colleagues believe that
[A] talent is a dominating factor for professional success.
[B] biographical data provide the key to excellent performance.
[C] the role of talent tends to be overlooked.
[D] high achievers owe their success mostly to nurture.
25.	Which of the following proverbs is closest to the message the text tries to 

convey?
[A] ¡°Faith will move mountains.¡±
[B] ¡°One reaps what one sows.¡±
[C] ¡°Practice makes perfect.¡±
[D] ¡°Like father, like son.¡±
Text 2
For the past several years, the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade has featured a column 

called ¡°Ask Marilyn.¡± People are invited to query Marilyn vos Savant, who at age 10 had 

tested at a mental level of someone about 23 years old; that gave her an IQ of 228 ¨C the 

highest score ever recorded. IQ tests ask you to complete verbal and visual analogies, to 

envision paper after it has been folded and cut, and to deduce numerical sequences, among 

other similar tasks. So it is a bit confusing when vos Savant fields such queries from the 

average Joe (whose IQ is 100) as, What¡¯s the difference between love and fondness? Or 

what is the nature of luck and coincidence? It¡¯s not obvious how the capacity to 

visualize objects and to figure out numerical patterns suits one to answer questions that 

have eluded some of the best poets and philosophers.
Clearly, intelligence encompasses more than a score on a test. Just what does it mean to 

be smart? How much of intelligence can be specified, and how much can we learn about it 

from neurology, genetics, computer science and other fields?
The defining term of intelligence in humans still seems to be the IQ score, even though IQ 

tests are not given as often as they used to be. The test comes primarily in two forms: 

the Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scale and the Wechsler Intelligence Scales (both come in 

adult and children¡¯s version). Generally costing several hundred dollars, they are 

usually given only by psychologists, although variations of them populate bookstores and 

the World Wide Web. Superhigh scores like vos Savant¡¯s are no longer possible, because 

scoring is now based on a statistical population distribution among age peers, rather than 

simply dividing the mental age by the chronological age and multiplying by 100. Other 

standardized tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the Graduate Record 

Exam (GRE), capture the main aspects of IQ tests.
Such standardized tests may not assess all the important elements necessary to succeed in 

school and in life, argues Robert J. Sternberg. In his article ¡°How Intelligent Is 

Intelligence Testing?¡±, Sternberg notes that traditional test best assess analytical and 

verbal skills but fail to measure creativity and practical knowledge, components also 

critical to problem solving and life success. Moreover, IQ tests do not necessarily 

predict so well once populations or situations change. Research has found that IQ 

predicted leadership skills when the tests were given under low-stress conditions, but 

under high-stress conditions, IQ was negatively correlated with leadership ¨C that is, it 

predicted the opposite. Anyone who has toiled through SAT will testify that test-taking 

skill also matters, whether it¡¯s knowing when to guess or what questions to skip.
26.	Which of the following may be required in an intelligence test?
[A] Answering philosophical questions.
[B] Folding or cutting paper into different shapes.
[C] Telling the differences between certain concepts.
[D] Choosing words or graphs similar to the given ones.
27.	What can be inferred about intelligence testing from Paragraph 3?
[A] People no longer use IQ scores as an indicator of intelligence.
[B] More versions of IQ tests are now available on the Internet.
[C] The test contents and formats for adults and children may be different.
[D] Scientists have defined the important elements of human intelligence.
28.	People nowadays can no longer achieve IQ scores as high as vos Savant¡¯s because
[A] the scores are obtained through different computational procedures.
[B] creativity rather than analytical skills is emphasized now.
[C] vos Savant¡¯s case is an extreme one that will not repeat.
[D] the defining characteristic of IQ tests has changed.
29.	We can conclude from the last paragraph that
[A] test scores may not be reliable indicators of one¡¯s ability.
[B] IQ scores and SAT results are highly correlated.
[C] testing involves a lot of guesswork.
[D] traditional test are out of date.
30.	What is the author¡¯s attitude towards IQ tests?
[A] Supportive.
[B] Skeptical.
[C] Impartial.
[D] Biased.
Text 3
During the past generation, the American middle-class family that once could count on hard 

work and fair play to keep itself financially secure had been transformed by economic risk 

and new realities. Now a pink slip, a bad diagnosis, or a disappearing spouse can reduce a 

family from solidly middle class to newly poor in a few months.
In just one generation, millions of mothers have gone to work, transforming basic family 

economics. Scholars, policymakers, and critics of all stripes have debated the social 

implications of these changes, but few have looked at the side effect: family risk has 

risen as well. Today¡¯s families have budgeted to the limits of their new two-paycheck 

status. As a result, they have lost the parachute they once had in times of financial 

setback ¨C a back-up earner (usually Mom) who could go into the workforce if the primary 

earner got laid off or fell sick. This ¡°added-worker effect¡± could support the safety 

net offered by unemployment insurance or disability insurance to help families weather bad 

times. But today, a disruption to family fortunes can no longer be made up with extra 

income from an otherwise-stay-at-home partner.
During the same period, families have been asked to absorb much more risk in their 

retirement income. Steelworkers, airline employees, and now those in the auto industry are 

joining millions of families who must worry about interest rates, stock market 

fluctuation, and the harsh reality that they may outlive their retirement money. For much 

of the past year, President Bush campaigned to move Social Security to a saving-account 

model, with retirees trading much or all of their guaranteed payments for payments 

depending on investment returns. For younger families, the picture is not any better. Both 

the absolute cost of healthcare and the share of it borne by families have risen ¨C and 

newly fashionable health-savings plans are spreading from legislative halls to Wal-Mart 

workers, with much higher deductibles and a large new dose of investment risk for families

¡¯ future healthcare. Even demographics are working against the middle class family, as 

the odds of having a weak elderly parent ¨C and all the attendant need for physical and 

financial assistance ¨C have jumped eightfold in just one generation.
From the middle-class family perspective, much of this, understandably, looks far less 

like an opportunity to exercise more financial responsibility, and a good deal more like a 

frightening acceleration of the wholesale shift of financial risk onto their already 

overburdened shoulders. The financial fallout has begun, and the political fallout may not 

be far behind.
31.	Today¡¯s double-income families are at greater financial risk in that
[A] the safety net they used to enjoy has disappeared.
[B] their chances of being laid off have greatly increased.
[C] they are more vulnerable to changes in family economics.
[D] they are deprived of unemployment or disability insurance.
32.	As a result of President Bush¡¯s reform, retired people may have
[A] a higher sense of security.
[B] less secured payments.
[C] less chance to invest.
[D] a guaranteed future.
33.	According to the author, health-savings plans will
[A] help reduce the cost of healthcare.
[B] popularize among the middle class.
[C] compensate for the reduced pensions.
[D] increase the families¡¯ investment risk.
34.	It can be inferred from the last paragraph that
[A] financial risks tend to outweigh political risks.
[B] the middle class may face greater political challenges.
[C] financial problems may bring about political problems.
[D] financial responsibility is an indicator of political status.
35.	Which of the following is the best title for this text?
[A] The Middle Class on the Alert
[B] The Middle Class on the Cliff
[C] The Middle Class in Conflict
[D] The Middle Class in Ruins
Text 4
It never rains but it pours. Just as bosses and boards have finally sorted out their worst 

accounting and compliance troubles, and improved their feeble corporation governance, a 

new problem threatens to earn them ¨C especially in America ¨C the sort of nasty headlines 

that inevitably lead to heads rolling in the executive suite: data insecurity. Left, until 

now, to odd, low-level IT staff to put right, and seen as a concern only of data-rich 

industries such as banking, telecoms and air travel, information protection is now high on 

the boss¡¯s agenda in businesses of every variety.
Several massive leakages of customer and employee data this year ¨C from organizations as 

diverse as Time Warner, the American defense contractor Science Applications International 

Corp and even the University of California, Berkeley ¨C have left managers hurriedly 

peering into their intricate IT systems and business processes in search of potential 

vulnerabilities.
¡°Data is becoming an asset which needs to be guarded as much as any other asset,¡± says 

Haim Mendelson of Stanford University¡¯s business school. ¡°The ability to guard customer 

data is the key to market value, which the board is responsible for on behalf of 

shareholders.¡± Indeed, just as there is the concept of Generally Accepted Accounting 

Principles (GAAP), perhaps it is time for GASP, Generally Accepted Security Practices, 

suggested Eli Noam of New York¡¯s Columbia Business School. ¡°Setting the proper 

investment level for security, redundancy, and recovery is a management issue, not a 

technical one,¡± he says.
The mystery is that this should come as a surprise to any boss. Surely it should be 

obvious to the dimmest executive that trust, that most valuable of economic assets, is 

easily destroyed and hugely expensive to restore ¨C and that few things are more likely to 

destroy trust than a company letting sensitive personal data get into the wrong hands.
The current state of affairs may have been encouraged ¨C though not justified ¨C by the 

lack of legal penalty (in America, but not Europe) for data leakage. Until California 

recently passed a law, American firms did not have to tell anyone, even the victim, when 

data went astray. That may change fast: lots of proposed data-security legislation is now 

doing the rounds in Washington, D.C. Meanwhile, the theft of information about some 40 

million credit-card accounts in America, disclosed on June 17th, overshadowed a hugely 

important decision a day earlier by America¡¯s Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that puts 

corporate America on notice that regulators will act if firms fail to provide adequate 

data security.
36.	The statement ¡°It never rains but it pours¡± is used to introduce
[A] the fierce business competition.
[B] the feeble boss-board relations.
[C] the threat from news reports.
[D] the severity of data leakage.
37.	According to Paragraph 2, some organizations check their systems to find out
[A] whether there is any weak point.
[B] what sort of data has been stolen.
[C] who is responsible for the leakage.
[D] how the potential spies can be located.
38.	In bringing up the concept of GASP the author is making the point that
[A] shareholders¡¯ interests should be properly attended to.
[B] information protection should be given due attention.
[C] businesses should enhance their level of accounting security.
[D] the market value of customer data should be emphasized.
39.	According to Paragraph 4, what puzzles the author is that some bosses fail to
[A] see the link between trust and data protection.
[B] perceive the sensitivity of personal data.
[C] realize the high cost of data restoration.
[D] appreciate the economic value of trust.
40.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 5 that
[A] data leakage is more severe in Europe.
[B] FTC¡¯s decision is essential to data security.
[C] California takes the lead in security legislation.
[D] legal penalty is a major solution to data leakage.

Part B
Directions:
You are going to read a list of headings and a text about what parents are supposed to do 

to guide their children into adulthood. Choose a heading from the list A¡ªG that best fits 

the meaning of each numbered part of the text (41-45). The first and last paragraphs of 

the text are not numbered. There are two extra headings that you do not need to use. Mark 

your answers on ANSWER SHEET 1. (10 points)
A. Set a Good Example for Your Kids
B. Build Your Kids¡¯ Work Skills
C. Place Time Limits on Leisure Activities
D. Talk about the Future on a Regular Basis
E. Help Kids Develop Coping Strategies
F. Help Your Kids Figure Out Who They Are
G. Build Your Kids¡¯ Sense of Responsibility
How Can a Parent Help?
Mothers and fathers can do a lot to ensure a safe landing in early adulthood for their 

kids. Even if a job¡¯s starting salary seems too small to satisfy an emerging adult¡¯s 

need for rapid content, the transition from school to work can be less of a setback if the 

start-up adult is ready for the move. Here are a few measures, drawn from my book Ready or 

Not, Here Life Comes, that parents can take to prevent what I call ¡°work-life 

unreadiness.¡±
 41  http://www.TopSage.com
You can start this process when they are 11 or 12. Periodically review their emerging 

strengths and weaknesses with them and work together on any shortcomings, like difficulty 

in communicating well or collaborating. Also, identify the kinds of interests they keep 

coming back to, as these offer clues to the careers that will fit them best.
 42  http://www.TopSage.com
Kids need a range of authentic role models ¨C as opposed to members of their clique, pop 

stars and vaunted athletes. Have regular dinner-table discussions about people the family 

knows and how they got where they are. Discuss the joys and downsides of your own career 

and encourage your kids to form some ideas about their own future. When asked what they 

want to do, they should be discouraged from saying ¡°I have no idea.¡± They can change 

their minds 200 times, but having only a foggy view of the future is of little good.
 43  http://www.TopSage.com
Teachers are responsible for teaching kids how to learn; parents should be responsible for 

teaching them how to work. Assign responsibilities around the house and make sure homework 

deadlines are met. Encourage teenagers to take a part-time job. Kids need plenty of 

practice delaying gratification and deploying effective organizational skills, such as 

managing time and setting priorities.
 44  http://www.TopSage.com
Playing video games encourages immediate content. And hours of watching TV shows with 

canned laughter only teaches kids to process information in a passive way. At the same 

time, listening through earphones to the same monotonous beats for long stretches 

encourages kids to stay inside their bubble instead of pursuing other endeavors. All these 

activities can prevent the growth of important communication and thinking skills and make 

it difficult for kids to develop the kind of sustained concentration they will need for 

most jobs.
 45  http://www.TopSage.com
They should know how to deal with setbacks, stresses and feelings of inadequacy. They 

should also learn how to solve problems and resolve conflicts, ways to brainstorm and 

think critically. Discussions at home can help kids practice doing these things and help 

them apply these skills to everyday life situations.
What about the son or daughter who is grown but seems to be struggling and wandering 

aimlessly through early adulthood? Parents still have a major role to play, but now it is 

more delicate. They have to be careful not to come across as disappointed in their child. 

They should exhibit strong interest and respect for whatever currently interests their 

fledging adult (as naive or ill conceived as it may seem) while becoming a partner in 

exploring options for the future. Most of all, these new adults must feel that they are 

respected and supported by a family that appreciates them.

Part C
Directions:
Read the following text carefully and then translate the underlined segments into Chinese. 

Your translation should be written clearly on ANSWER SHEET 2. (10 points)
The study of law has been recognized for centuries as a basic intellectual discipline in 

European universities. However, only in recent years has it become a feature of 

undergraduate programs in Canadian universities. (46) Traditionally, legal learning has 

been viewed in such institutions as the special preserve of lawyers, rather than a 

necessary part of the intellectual equipment of an educated person. Happily, the older and 

more continental view of legal education is establishing itself in a number of Canadian 

universities and some have even begun to offer undergraduate degrees in law.
If the study of law is beginning to establish itself as part and parcel of a general 

education, its aims and methods should appeal directly to journalism educators. Law is a 

discipline which encourages responsible judgment. On the one hand, it provides 

opportunities to analyze such ideas as justice, democracy and freedom. (47) On the other, 

it links these concepts to everyday realities in a manner which is parallel to the links 

journalists forge on a daily basis as they cover and comment on the news. For example, 

notions of evidence and fact, of basic rights and public interest are at work in the 

process of journalistic judgment and production just as in courts of law. Sharpening 

judgment by absorbing and reflecting on law is a desirable component of a journalist¡¯s 

intellectual preparation for his or her career.
(48) But the idea that the journalist must understand the law more profoundly than an 

ordinary citizen rests on an understanding of the established conventions and special 

responsibilities of the news media. Politics or, more broadly, the functioning of the 

state, is a major subject for journalists. The better informed they are about the way the 

state works, the better their reporting will be. (49) In fact, it is difficult to see how 

journalists who do not have a clear grasp of the basic features of the Canadian 

Constitution can do a competent job on political stories.
Furthermore, the legal system and the events which occur within it are primary subjects 

for journalists. While the quality of legal journalism varies greatly, there is an undue 

reliance amongst many journalists on interpretations supplied to them by lawyers. (50) 

While comment and reaction from lawyers may enhance stories, it is preferable for 

journalists to rely on their own notions of significance and make their own judgments. 

These can only come from a well-grounded understanding of the legal system.

¡¡¡¡To whom it may concern£¬As a senior student of the university£¬I am writing the letter 

to make some suggestions for improving the service of our university library.
¡¡¡¡On the whole£¬I think our library functions pretty well£¬but its service is far from 

being perfect.Firstly£¬it is quite convenient to arrange an inquiry desk at the 

circulation hall£¬which enables the students to ask questions whenever necessary.Then£¬

with the help of a professional librarian£¬students can go through the procedures more 

efficiently.In addition£¬it would be most helpful if the students have access to the 

latest Issues of foreign magazines.Lastly£¬you'd better maintain strict order at the 

reading room.I frequently found myself Disturbed by certain students chatting and smoking 

there.
¡¡¡¡It is my sincere hope that you will take my advice into consideration and I hold that 

it will benefit both the students and the university faculty as well.
Sincerely yours£¬

with two players facing each other.One player is going to kick the ball while the 

goalkeeper is standing in front of a goal£¬ready to protect it.But both parties are losing 

their confidence.The striker magnifies the goalkeeper in his mind so that chances of 

shooting in are slim.Likewise£¬the goalkeeper minimizes his own image as if he couldn't

Text 1
In spite of ¡°endless talk of difference,¡± American society is an amazing machine for 

homogenizing people. There is ¡°the democratizing uniformity of dress and discourse, and 

the casualness and absence of deference¡± characteristic of popular culture. People are 

absorbed into ¡°a culture of consumption¡± launched by the 19th-century department stores 

that offered ¡°vast arrays of goods in an elegant atmosphere. Instead of intimate shops 

catering to a knowledgeable elite,¡± these were stores ¡°anyone could enter, regardless of 

class or background. This turned shopping into a public and democratic act.¡± The mass 

media, advertising and sports are other forces for homogenization.
Immigrants are quickly fitting into this common culture, which may not be altogether 

elevating but is hardly poisonous. Writing for the National Immigration Forum, Gregory 

Rodriguez reports that today¡¯s immigration is neither at unprecedented levels nor 

resistant to assimilation. In 1998 immigrants were 9.8 percent of population; in 1900, 

13.6 percent. In the 10 years prior to 1990, 3.1 immigrants arrived for every 1,000 

residents; in the 10 years prior to 1890, 9.2 for every 1,000. Now, consider three indices 

of assimilation -- language, home ownership and intermarriage.
The 1990 Census revealed that ¡°a majority of immigrants from each of the fifteen most 

common countries of origin spoke English ¡®well¡¯ or ¡®very well¡¯ after ten years of 

residence.¡± The children of immigrants tend to be bilingual and proficient in English. ¡°

By the third generation, the original language is lost in the majority of immigrant 

families.¡± Hence the description of America as a ¡°graveyard¡± for languages. By 1996 

foreign-born immigrants who had arrived before 1970 had a home ownership rate of 75.6 

percent, higher than the 69.8 percent rate among native-born Americans.
Foreign-born Asians and Hispanics ¡°have higher rates of intermarriage than do U.S.-born 

whites and blacks.¡± By the third generation, one third of Hispanic women are married to 

non-Hispanics, and 41 percent of Asian-American women are married to non-Asians.
Rodriguez notes that children in remote villages around the world are fans of superstars 

like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks, yet ¡°some Americans fear that immigrants 

living within the United States remain somehow immune to the nation¡¯s assimilative power.

¡±
Are there divisive issues and pockets of seething anger in America? Indeed. It is big 

enough to have a bit of everything. But particularly when viewed against America¡¯s 

turbulent past, today¡¯s social indices hardly suggest a dark and deteriorating social 

environment.
21.	The word ¡°homogenizing¡± (Line 2, Paragraph 1) most probably means ________.
[A] identifying
[B] associating
[C] assimilating
[D] monopolizing
22.	According to the author, the department stores of the 19th century ________.
[A] played a role in the spread of popular culture
[B] became intimate shops for common consumers
[C] satisfied the needs of a knowledgeable elite
[D] owed its emergence to the culture of consumption
23.	The text suggests that immigrants now in the U.S. ________.
[A] are resistant to homogenization
[B] exert a great influence on American culture
[C] are hardly a threat to the common culture
[D] constitute the majority of the population
24.	Why are Arnold Schwarzenegger and Garth Brooks mentioned in Paragraph 5?
[A] To prove their popularity around the world.
[B] To reveal the public¡¯s fear of immigrants.
[C] To give examples of successful immigrants.
[D] To show the powerful influence of American culture.
25.	In the author¡¯s opinion, the absorption of immigrants into American society is 

________.
[A] rewarding
[B] successful
[C] fruitless
[D] harmful
Text 2
Stratford-on-Avon, as we all know, has only one industry -- William Shakespeare -- but 

there are two distinctly separate and increasingly hostile branches. There is the Royal 

Shakespeare Company (RSC), which presents superb productions of the plays at the 

Shakespeare Memorial Theatre on the Avon. And there are the townsfolk who largely live off 

the tourists who come, not to see the plays, but to look at Anne Hathaway¡¯s Cottage, 

Shakespeare¡¯s birthplace and the other sights.
The worthy residents of Stratford doubt that the theatre adds a penny to their revenue. 

They frankly dislike the RSC¡¯s actors, them with their long hair and beards and sandals 

and noisiness. It¡¯s all deliciously ironic when you consider that Shakespeare, who earns 

their living, was himself an actor (with a beard) and did his share of noise-making.
The tourist streams are not entirely separate. The sightseers who come by bus -- and often 

take in Warwick Castle and Blenheim Palace on the side -- don¡¯t usually see the plays, 

and some of them are even surprised to find a theatre in Stratford. However, the playgoers 

do manage a little sight-seeing along with their playgoing. It is the playgoers, the RSC 

contends, who bring in much of the town¡¯s revenue because they spend the night (some of 

them four or five nights) pouring cash into the hotels and restaurants. The sightseers can 

take in everything and get out of town by nightfall.
The townsfolk don¡¯t see it this way and local council does not contribute directly to the 

subsidy of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Stratford cries poor traditionally. Nevertheless 

every hotel in town seems to be adding a new wing or cocktail lounge. Hilton is building 

its own hotel there, which you may be sure will be decorated with Hamlet Hamburger Bars, 

the Lear Lounge, the Banquo Banqueting Room, and so forth, and will be very expensive.
Anyway, the townsfolk can¡¯t understand why the Royal Shakespeare Company needs a subsidy. 

(The theatre has broken attendance records for three years in a row. Last year its 1,431 

seats were 94 percent occupied all year long and this year they¡¯ll do better.) The 

reason, of course, is that costs have rocketed and ticket prices have stayed low.
It would be a shame to raise prices too much because it would drive away the young people 

who are Stratford¡¯s most attractive clientele. They come entirely for the plays, not the 

sights. They all seem to look alike (though they come from all over) -- lean, pointed, 

dedicated faces, wearing jeans and sandals, eating their buns and bedding down for the 

night on the flagstones outside the theatre to buy the 20 seats and 80 standing-room 

tickets held for the sleepers and sold to them when the box office opens at 10:30 a.m.
26.	From the first two paragraphs, we learn that ________.
[A] the townsfolk deny the RSC¡¯s contribution to the town¡¯s revenue
[B] the actors of the RSC imitate Shakespeare on and off stage
[C] the two branches of the RSC are not on good terms
[D] the townsfolk earn little from tourism
27.	It can be inferred from Paragraph 3 that ________.
[A] the sightseers cannot visit the Castle and the Palace separately
[B] the playgoers spend more money than the sightseers
[C] the sightseers do more shopping than the playgoers
[D] the playgoers go to no other places in town than the theater
28.	By saying ¡°Stratford cries poor traditionally¡± (Line 2-3, Paragraph 4), the 

author implies that ________.
[A] Stratford cannot afford the expansion projects
[B] Stratford has long been in financial difficulties
[C] the town is not really short of money
[D] the townsfolk used to be poorly paid
29.	According to the townsfolk, the RSC deserves no subsidy because ________.
[A] ticket prices can be raised to cover the spending
[B] the company is financially ill-managed
[C] the behavior of the actors is not socially acceptable
[D] the theatre attendance is on the rise
30.	From the text we can conclude that the author ________.
[A] is supportive of both sides
[B] favors the townsfolk¡¯s view
[C] takes a detached attitude
[D] is sympathetic to the RSC
Text 3
When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strange happened to the 

large animals. They suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived. The large, slow-

growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something 

similar could be happening in the oceans.
That the seas are being overfished has been known for years. What researchers such as 

Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown is just how fast things are changing. They have 

looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not 

attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish 

species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. 

According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators 

(animals that kill and eat other animals) in a new fishery is reduced on average by 80% 

within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved 

again since then.
Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative. One reason for this is that 

fishing technology has improved. Today¡¯s vessels can find their prey using satellites and 

sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in 

the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be 

worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines 

would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been 

caught, since no baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an 

underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline 

fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a 

problem, because there are fewer sharks around now.
Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future 

management efforts must take into account. They believe the data support an idea current 

among marine biologists, that of the ¡°shifting baseline.¡± The notion is that people have 

failed to detect the massive changes which have happened in the ocean because they have 

been looking back only a relatively short time into the past. That matters because theory 

suggests that the maximum sustainable yield that can be cropped from a fishery comes when 

the biomass of a target species is about 50% of its original levels. Most fisheries are 

well below that, which is a bad way to do business.
31.	The extinction of large prehistoric animals is noted to suggest that ________.
[A] large animal were vulnerable to the changing environment
[B] small species survived as large animals disappeared
[C] large sea animals may face the same threat today
[D] slow-growing fish outlive fast-growing ones
32.	We can infer from Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm¡¯s paper that ________.
[A] the stock of large predators in some old fisheries has reduced by 90%
[B] there are only half as many fisheries as there were 15 years ago
[C] the catch sizes in new fisheries are only 20% of the original amount
[D] the number of larger predators dropped faster in new fisheries than in the old
33.	By saying "these figures are conservative" (Line 1, paragraph 3), Dr. Worm means 

that ________.
[A] fishing technology has improved rapidly
[B] the catch-sizes are actually smaller than recorded
[C] the marine biomass has suffered a greater loss
[D] the data collected so far are out of date
34.	Dr. Myers and other researchers hold that ________.
[A] people should look for a baseline that can work for a longer time
[B] fisheries should keep their yields below 50% of the biomass
[C] the ocean biomass should be restored to its original level
[D] people should adjust the fishing baseline to the changing situation
35.	The author seems to be mainly concerned with most fisheries¡¯ ________.
[A] management efficiency
[B] biomass level
[C] catch-size limits
[D] technological application
Text 4
Many things make people think artists are weird. But the weirdest may be this: artists¡¯ 

only job is to explore emotions, and yet they choose to focus on the ones that feel bad.
This wasn¡¯t always so. The earliest forms of art, like painting and music, are those best 

suited for expressing joy. But somewhere from the 19th century onward, more artists began 

seeing happiness as meaningless, phony or, worst of all, boring, as we went from 

Wordsworth¡¯s daffodils to Baudelaire¡¯s flowers of evil.
You could argue that art became more skeptical of happiness because modern times have seen 

so much misery. But it¡¯s not as if earlier times didn¡¯t know perpetual war, disaster and 

the massacre of innocents. The reason, in fact, may be just the opposite: there is too 

much damn happiness in the world today.
After all, what is the one modern form of expression almost completely dedicated to 

depicting happiness? Advertising. The rise of anti-happy art almost exactly tracks the 

emergence of mass media, and with it, a commercial culture in which happiness is not just 

an ideal but an ideology.
People in earlier eras were surrounded by reminders of misery. They worked until 

exhausted, lived with few protections and died young. In the West, before mass 

communication and literacy, the most powerful mass medium was the church, which reminded 

worshippers that their souls were in danger and that they would someday be meat for worms. 

Given all this, they did not exactly need their art to be a bummer too.
Today the messages the average Westerner is surrounded with are not religious but 

commercial, and forever happy. Fast-food eaters, news anchors, text messengers, all 

smiling, smiling, smiling. Our magazines feature beaming celebrities and happy families in 

perfect homes. And since these messages have an agenda -- to lure us to open our wallets 

-- they make the very idea of happiness seem unreliable. ¡°Celebrate!¡± commanded the ads 

for the arthritis drug Celebrex, before we found out it could increase the risk of heart 

attacks.
But what we forget -- what our economy depends on us forgetting -- is that happiness is 

more than pleasure without pain. The things that bring the greatest joy carry the greatest 

potential for loss and disappointment. Today, surrounded by promises of easy happiness, we 

need art to tell us, as religion once did, Memento mori: remember that you will die, that 

everything ends, and that happiness comes not in denying this but in living with it. It¡¯s 

a message even more bitter than a clove cigarette, yet, somehow, a breath of fresh air.

ANSWER SHEET 1. (10 points)
On the north bank of the Ohio river sits Evansville, Ind., home of David Williams, 52, and 

of a riverboat casino (a place where gambling games are played). During several years of 

gambling in that casino, Williams, a state auditor earning $35,000 a year, lost 

approximately $175,000. He had never gambled before the casino sent him a coupon for $20 

worth of gambling.
He visited the casino, lost the $20 and left. On his second visit he lost $800. The casino 

issued to him, as a good customer, a "Fun Card", which when used in the casino earns 

points for meals and drinks, and enables the casino to track the user¡¯s gambling 

activities. For Williams, those activities become what he calls "electronic heroin".
(41) ________. In 1997 he lost $21,000 to one slot machine in two days. In March 1997 he 

lost $72,186. He sometimes played two slot machines at a time, all night, until the boat 

docked at 5 a.m., then went back aboard when the casino opened at 9 a.m. Now he is suing 

the casino, charging that it should have refused his patronage because it knew he was 

addicted. It did know he had a problem.
In March 1998 a friend of Williams¡¯s got him involuntarily confined to a treatment center 

for addictions, and wrote to inform the casino of Williams¡¯s gambling problem. The casino 

included a photo of Williams among those of banned gamblers, and wrote to him a ¡°cease 

admissions¡± letter. Noting the medical/psychological nature of problem gambling behavior, 

the letter said that before being readmitted to the casino he would have to present 

medical/psychological information demonstrating that patronizing the casino would pose no 

threat to his safety or well-being.
(42) ________.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the casino has 24 signs warning: ¡°Enjoy the fun... 

and always bet with your head, not over it.¡± Every entrance ticket lists a toll-free 

number for counseling from the Indiana Department of Mental Health. Nevertheless, Williams

¡¯s suit charges that the casino, knowing he was ¡°helplessly addicted to gambling,¡± 

intentionally worked to ¡°lure¡± him to ¡°engage in conduct against his will.¡± Well.
(43) ________.
The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders says 

¡°pathological gambling¡± involves persistent, recurring and uncontrollable pursuit less 

of money than of thrill of taking risks in quest of a windfall.
(44) ________. Pushed by science, or what claims to be science, society is reclassifying 

what once were considered character flaws or moral failings as personality disorders akin 

to physical disabilities.
(45) ________.
Forty-four states have lotteries, 29 have casinos, and most of these states are to varying 

degrees dependent on -- you might say addicted to -- revenues from wagering. And since the 

first Internet gambling site was created in 1995, competition for gamblers¡¯ dollars has 

become intense. The Oct. 28 issue of Newsweek reported that 2 million gamblers patronize 

1,800 virtual casinos every week. With $3.5 billion being lost on Internet wagers this 

year, gambling has passed pornography as the Web¡¯s most profitable business.
[A]	Although no such evidence was presented, the casino¡¯s marketing department 

continued to pepper him with mailings. And he entered the casino and used his Fun Card 

without being detected.
[B]	It is unclear what luring was required, given his compulsive behavior. And in what 

sense was his will operative?
[C]	By the time he had lost $5,000 he said to himself that if he could get back to 

even, he would quit. One night he won $5,500, but he did not quit.
[D]	Gambling has been a common feature of American life forever, but for a long time 

it was broadly considered a sin, or a social disease. Now it is a social policy: the most 

important and aggressive promoter of gambling in America is the government.
[E]	David Williams¡¯s suit should trouble this gambling nation. But don¡¯t bet on it.
[F]	It is worrisome that society is medicalizing more and more behavioral problems, 

often defining as addictions what earlier, sterner generations explained as weakness of 

will.
[G]	The anonymous, lonely, undistracted nature of online gambling is especially 

conducive to compulsive behavior. But even if the government knew how to move against 

Internet gambling, what would be its grounds for doing so?

Is it true that the American intellectual is rejected and considered of no account in his 

society? I am going to suggest that it is not true. Father Bruckberger told part of the 

story when he observed that it is the intellectuals who have rejected America. But they 

have done more than that. They have grown dissatisfied with the role of intellectual. It 

is they, not America, who have become anti-intellectual.
First, the object of our study pleads for definition. What is an intellectual? 46) I shall 

define him as an individual who has elected as his primary duty and pleasure in life the 

activity of thinking in a Socratic (ËÕ¸ñÀ­µ×) way about moral problems. He explores such 

problems consciously, articulately, and frankly, first by asking factual questions, then 

by asking moral questions, finally by suggesting action which seems appropriate in the 

light of the factual and moral information which he has obtained. 47) His function is 

analogous to that of a judge, who must accept the obligation of revealing in as obvious a 

manner as possible the course of reasoning which led him to his decision.
This definition excludes many individuals usually referred to as intellectuals -- the 

average scientist, for one. 48) I have excluded him because, while his accomplishments may 

contribute to the solution of moral problems, he has not been charged with the task of 

approaching any but the factual aspects of those problems. Like other human beings, he 

encounters moral issues even in the everyday performance of his routine duties -- he is 

not supposed to cook his experiments, manufacture evidence, or doctor his reports. 49) But 

his primary task is not to think about the moral code which governs his activity, any more 

than a businessman is expected to dedicate his energies to an exploration of rules of 

conduct in business. During most of his waking life he will take his code for granted, as 

the businessman takes his ethics.
The definition also excludes the majority of teachers, despite the fact that teaching has 

traditionally been the method whereby many intellectuals earn their living. 50) They may 

teach very well and more than earn their salaries, but most of them make little or no 

independent reflections on human problems which involve moral judgment. This description 

even fits the majority of eminent scholars. Being learned in some branch of human 

knowledge is one thing, living in "public and illustrious thoughts,¡± as Emerson would 

say, is something else.

I wonder if it is convenient for you if three things concerning the child are taken into 

consideration. First, the child should come from Gansu Province, for I intend to help a 

child from my hometown. Second, it will be better if the child is a primary school 

student. I hope I will help him/her from the very beginning. In addition, he/she must be 

willing to return to his hometown to help built it after graduation from university.
My plan will be carried out as follows. On one hand, I will remit at least 2,000 Yuan in 

cash every year until he/she finishes his/her education before entering college. On the 

other hand, I decide to teach the child math and English in person during my summer 

vacation, which will surely be more beneficial to the child.
Your prompt help would be highly appreciated. And I am looking forward to your reply very

How ironic the two pictures are in describing one of the most widespread social phenomena 

concerning idol adoration! In the first picture, a young man writes the name of Beckham on 

his face. In the second picture, another young man spends 300 Yuan in dealing with his 

hair to make himself look like Beckham.
The meaning conveyed in the two pictures reveals that in current China some young people 

are losing themselves. I am greatly shocked by the enthusiasm for this British football 

superstar shown by these two young men. Frankly speaking, things of this kind really 

happen among us. Some people, especially college students, do nothing but concentrate on 

imitating superstars. This does great harm to their study and growth. If we can¡¯t stop 

the worsening of this tendency, our own culture will be damaged, and we ourselves will be 

the ultimate victims.
From my point of view, a lot of measures should be taken to save our losing culture and 

re-find ourselves. In fact, some measures have already been taken. In my university, 

campaigns have been launched to educate people to pay more attention to our traditional 

culture and read more books instead of focusing on our appearances. As a result, we have 

witnessed some improvements but still there is a long way to go.

The human nose is an underrated tool. Humans are often thought to be insensitive smellers 

compared with animals,  1  this is largely because,  2  animals, we stand upright. This 

means that our noses are  3  to perceiving those smells which float through the air,  4

  the majority of smells which stick to surfaces. In fact,  5 , we are extremely 

sensitive to smells,  6  we do not generally realize it. Our noses are capable of  7  

human smells even when these are  8  to far below one part in one million.
Strangely, some people find that they can smell one type of flower but not another,  9  

others are sensitive to the smells of both flowers. This may be because some people do not 

have the genes necessary to generate  10  smell receptors in the nose. These receptors 

are the cells which sense smells and send  11  to the brain. However, it has been found 

that even people insensitive to a certain smell  12  can suddenly become sensitive to it 

when  13  to it often enough.
The explanation for insensitivity to smell seems to be that the brain finds it  14  to 

keep all smell receptors working all the time but can  15  new receptors if necessary.

Text 1
Everybody loves a fat pay rise. Yet pleasure at your own can vanish if you learn that a 

colleague has been given a bigger one. Indeed, if he has a reputation for slacking, you 

might even be outraged. Such behaviour is regarded as ¡°all too human,¡± with the 

underlying assumption that other animals would not be capable of this finely developed 

sense of grievance. But a study by Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal of Emory University in 

Atlanta, Georgia, which has just been published in Nature, suggests that it is all too 

monkey, as well.
The researchers studied the behaviour of female brown capuchin monkeys. They look cute. 

They are good-natured, co-operative creatures, and they share their food readily. Above 

all, like their female human counterparts, they tend to pay much closer attention to the 

value of ¡°goods and services¡± than males.
Such characteristics make them perfect candidates for Dr. Brosnan¡¯s and Dr. de Waal¡¯s 

study. The researchers spent two years teaching their monkeys to exchange tokens for food. 

Normally, the monkeys were happy enough to exchange pieces of rock for slices of cucumber. 

However, when two monkeys were placed in separate but adjoining chambers, so that each 

could observe what the other was getting in return for its rock, their behaviour became 

markedly different.
In the world of capuchins, grapes are luxury goods (and much preferable to cucumbers). So 

when one monkey was handed a grape in exchange for her token, the second was reluctant to 

hand hers over for a mere piece of cucumber. And if one received a grape without having to 

provide her token in exchange at all, the other either tossed her own token at the 

researcher or out of the chamber, or refused to accept the slice of cucumber. Indeed, the 

mere presence of a grape in the other chamber (without an actual monkey to eat it) was 

enough to induce resentment in a female capuchin.
The researchers suggest that capuchin monkeys, like humans, are guided by social emotions. 

In the wild, they are a co-operative, group-living species. Such co-operation is likely to 

be stable only when each animal feels it is not being cheated. Feelings of righteous 

indignation, it seems, are not the preserve of people alone. Refusing a lesser reward 

completely makes these feelings abundantly clear to other members of the group. However, 

whether such a sense of fairness evolved independently in capuchins and humans, or whether 

it stems from the common ancestor that the species had 35 million years ago, is, as yet, 

an unanswered question.
21.	In the opening paragraph, the author introduces his topic by ________.
[A] posing a contrast
[B] justifying an assumption
[C] making a comparison
[D] explaining a phenomenon
22.	The statement ¡°it is all too monkey¡± (Last line, Paragraph l) implies that 

________.
[A] monkeys are also outraged by slack rivals
[B] resenting unfairness is also monkeys¡¯ nature
[C] monkeys, like humans, tend to be jealous of each other
[D] no animals other than monkeys can develop such emotions
23.	Female capuchin monkeys were chosen for the research most probably because they 

are ________.
[A] more inclined to weigh what they get
[B] attentive to researchers¡¯ instructions
[C] nice in both appearance and temperament
[D] more generous than their male companions
24.	Dr. Brosnan and Dr. de Waal have eventually found in their study that the monkeys 

________.
[A] prefer grapes to cucumbers
[B] can be taught to exchange things
[C] will not be co-operative if feeling cheated
[D] are unhappy when separated from others
25.	What can we infer from the last paragraph?
[A] Monkeys can be trained to develop social emotions.
[B] Human indignation evolved from an uncertain source.
[C] Animals usually show their feelings openly as humans do.
[D] Cooperation among monkeys remains stable only in the wild.

Do you remember all those years when scientists argued that smoking would kill us but the 

doubters insisted that we didn¡¯t know for sure? That the evidence was inconclusive, the 

science uncertain? That the antismoking lobby was out to destroy our way of life and the 

government should stay out of the way? Lots of Americans bought that nonsense, and over 

three decades, some 10 million smokers went to early graves.
There are upsetting parallels today, as scientists in one wave after another try to awaken 

us to the growing threat of global warming. The latest was a panel from the National 

Academy of Sciences, enlisted by the White House, to tell us that the Earth¡¯s atmosphere 

is definitely warming and that the problem is largely man-made. The clear message is that 

we should get moving to protect ourselves. The president of the National Academy, Bruce 

Alberts, added this key point in the preface to the panel¡¯s report: ¡°Science never has 

all the answers. But science does provide us with the best available guide to the future, 

and it is critical that our nation and the world base important policies on the best 

judgments that science can provide concerning the future consequences of present actions.

¡±
Just as on smoking, voices now come from many quarters insisting that the science about 

global warming is incomplete, that it¡¯s OK to keep pouring fumes into the air until we 

know for sure. This is a dangerous game: by the time 100 percent of the evidence is in, it 

may be too late. With the risks obvious and growing, a prudent people would take out an 

insurance policy now.
Fortunately, the White House is starting to pay attention. But it¡¯s obvious that a 

majority of the president¡¯s advisers still don¡¯t take global warming seriously. Instead 

of a plan of action, they continue to press for more research -- a classic case of 

¡°paralysis by analysis.¡±
To serve as responsible stewards of the planet, we must press forward on deeper 

atmospheric and oceanic research. But research alone is inadequate. If the Administration 

won¡¯t take the legislative initiative, Congress should help to begin fashioning 

conservation measures. A bill by Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, which 

would offer financial incentives for private industry, is a promising start. Many see that 

the country is getting ready to build lots of new power plants to meet our energy needs. 

If we are ever going to protect the atmosphere, it is crucial that those new plants be 

environmentally sound.
26.	An argument made by supporters of smoking was that ________.
[A] there was no scientific evidence of the correlation between smoking and death
[B] the number of early deaths of smokers in the past decades was insignificant
[C] people had the freedom to choose their own way of life
[D] antismoking people were usually talking nonsense

Text 3
Of all the components of a good night¡¯s sleep, dreams seem to be least within our 

control. In dreams, a window opens into a world where logic is suspended and dead people 

speak. A century ago, Freud formulated his revolutionary theory that dreams were the 

disguised shadows of our unconscious desires and fears; by the late 1970s, neurologists 

had switched to thinking of them as just ¡°mental noise¡± -- the random byproducts of the 

neural-repair work that goes on during sleep. Now researchers suspect that dreams are part 

of the mind¡¯s emotional thermostat, regulating moods while the brain is ¡°off-line.¡± And 

one leading authority says that these intensely powerful mental events can be not only 

harnessed but actually brought under conscious control, to help us sleep and feel better, 

¡°It¡¯s your dream,¡± says Rosalind Cartwright, chair of psychology at Chicago¡¯s Medical 

Center. ¡°If you don¡¯t like it, change it.¡±
Evidence from brain imaging supports this view. The brain is as active during REM (rapid 

eye movement) sleep -- when most vivid dreams occur -- as it is when fully awake, says Dr, 

Eric Nofzinger at the University of Pittsburgh. But not all parts of the brain are equally 

involved; the limbic system (the ¡°emotional brain¡±) is especially active, while the 

prefrontal cortex (the center of intellect and reasoning) is relatively quiet. ¡°We wake 

up from dreams happy or depressed, and those feelings can stay with us all day.¡± says 

Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement.
The link between dreams and emotions shows up among the patients in Cartwright¡¯s clinic. 

Most people seem to have more bad dreams early in the night, progressing toward happier 

ones before awakening, suggesting that they are working through negative feelings 

generated during the day. Because our conscious mind is occupied with daily life we don¡¯t 

always think about the emotional significance of the day¡¯s events -- until, it appears, 

we begin to dream.
And this process need not be left to the unconscious. Cartwright believes one can exercise 

conscious control over recurring bad dreams. As soon as you awaken, identify what is 

upsetting about the dream. Visualize how you would like it to end instead; the next time 

it occurs, try to wake up just enough to control its course. With much practice people can 

learn to, literally, do it in their sleep.
At the end of the day, there¡¯s probably little reason to pay attention to our dreams at 

all unless they keep us from sleeping or ¡°we wake up in a panic,¡± Cartwright says. 

Terrorism, economic uncertainties and general feelings of insecurity have increased people

¡¯s anxiety. Those suffering from persistent nightmares should seek help from a therapist. 

For the rest of us, the brain has its ways of working through bad feelings. Sleep -- or 

rather dream -- on it and you¡¯ll feel better in the morning.

Text 4
Americans no longer expect public figures, whether in speech or in writing, to command the 

English language with skill and gift. Nor do they aspire to such command themselves. In 

his latest book, Doing Our Own Thing: The Degradation of Language and Music and Why We 

Should, Like, Care, John McWhorter, a linguist and controversialist of mixed liberal and 

conservative views, sees the triumph of 1960s counter-culture as responsible for the 

decline of formal English.
Blaming the permissive 1960s is nothing new, but this is not yet another criticism against 

the decline in education. Mr. McWhorter¡¯s academic speciality is language history and 

change, and he sees the gradual disappearance of ¡°whom,¡± for example, to be natural and 

no more regrettable than the loss of the case-endings of Old English.
But the cult of the authentic and the personal, ¡°doing our own thing,¡± has spelt the 

death of formal speech, writing, poetry and music. While even the modestly educated sought 

an elevated tone when they put pen to paper before the 1960s, even the most well regarded 

writing since then has sought to capture spoken English on the page. Equally, in poetry, 

the highly personal, performative genre is the only form that could claim real liveliness. 

In both oral and written English, talking is triumphing over speaking, spontaneity over 

craft.
Illustrated with an entertaining array of examples from both high and low culture, the 

trend that Mr. McWhorter documents is unmistakable. But it is less clear, to take the 

question of his subtitle, why we should, like, care. As a linguist, he acknowledges that 

all varieties of human language, including non-standard ones like Black English, can be 

powerfully expressive -- there exists no language or dialect in the world that cannot 

convey complex ideas. He is not arguing, as many do, that we can no longer think straight 

because we do not talk proper.
Russians have a deep love for their own language and carry large chunks of memorized 

poetry in their heads, while Italian politicians tend to elaborate speech that would seem 

old-fashioned to most English-speakers. Mr. McWhorter acknowledges that formal language is 

not strictly necessary, and proposes no radical education reforms -- he is really grieving 

over the loss of something beautiful more than useful. We now take our English ¡°on paper 

plates instead of china.¡± A shame, perhaps, but probably an inevitable one.
36.	According to McWhorter, the decline of formal English ________.
[A] is inevitable in radical education reforms
[B] is but all too natural in language development
[C] has caused the controversy over the counter-culture
[D] brought about changes in public attitudes in the 1960s
37.	The word ¡°talking¡± (Line 6, Paragraph 3) denotes ________.
[A] modesty
[B] personality
[C] liveliness
[D] informality
38.	To which of the following statements would McWhorter most likely agree?
[A] Logical thinking is not necessarily related to the way we talk.
[B] Black English can be more expressive than standard English.
[C] Non-standard varieties of human language are just as entertaining.
[D] Of all the varieties, standard English can best convey complex ideas.
39.	The description of Russians¡¯ love of memorizing poetry shows the author¡¯s 

________.
[A] interest in their language
[B] appreciation of their efforts
[C] admiration for their memory
[D] contempt for their old-fashionedness
40.	According to the last paragraph, ¡°paper plates¡± is to ¡°china¡± as ________.

[B] ¡°radical¡± is to ¡°conservative¡±

Canada¡¯s premiers (the leaders of provincial governments), if they have any breath left 

after complaining about Ottawa at their late July annual meeting, might spare a moment to 

do something, together, to reduce health-care costs.
They¡¯re all groaning about soaring health budgets, the fastest-growing component of which 

are pharmaceutical costs.
41.	________
What to do? Both the Romanow commission and the Kirby committee on health care -- to say 

nothing of reports from other experts -- recommended the creation of a national drug 

agency. Instead of each province having its own list of approved drugs, bureaucracy, 

procedures and limited bargaining power, all would pool resources, work with Ottawa, and 

create a national institution.
42.	________
But ¡°national¡± doesn¡¯t have to mean that. ¡°National¡± could mean interprovincial -- 

provinces combining efforts to create one body.
Either way, one benefit of a ¡°national¡± organization would be to negotiate better 

prices, if possible, with drug manufacturers. Instead of having one province -- or a 

series of hospitals within a province -- negotiate a price for a given drug on the 

provincial list, the national agency would negotiate on behalf of all provinces.
Rather than, say, Quebec, negotiating on behalf of seven million people, the national 

agency would negotiate on behalf of 31 million people. Basic economics suggests the 

greater the potential consumers, the higher the likelihood of a better price.
43.	________
A small step has been taken in the direction of a national agency with the creation of the 

Canadian Co-ordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment, funded by Ottawa and the 

provinces. Under it, a Common Drug Review recommends to provincial lists which new drugs 

should be included. Predictably, and regrettably, Quebec refused to join.
A few premiers are suspicious of any federal-provincial deal-making. They (particularly 

Quebec and Alberta) just want Ottawa to fork over additional billions with few, if any, 

strings attached. That¡¯s one reason why the idea of a national list hasn¡¯t gone 

anywhere, while drug costs keep rising fast.
44.	________
Premiers love to quote Mr. Romanow¡¯s report selectively, especially the parts about more 

federal money. Perhaps they should read what he had to say about drugs: ¡°A national drug 

agency would provide governments more influence on pharmaceutical companies in order to 

constrain the ever-increasing cost of drugs.¡±
45.	________
So when the premiers gather in Niagara Falls to assemble their usual complaint list, they 

should also get cracking about something in their jurisdiction that would help their 

budgets and patients.
[A] Quebec¡¯s resistance to a national agency is provincialist ideology. One of the first 

advocates for a national list was a researcher at Laval University. Quebec¡¯s Drug 

Insurance Fund has seen its costs skyrocket with annual increases from 14.3 per cent to 

26.8 per cent!
[B] Or they could read Mr. Kirby¡¯s report: ¡°the substantial buying power of such an 

agency would strengthen the public prescription-drug insurance plans to negotiate the 

lowest possible purchase prices from drug companies.¡±
[C] What does ¡°national¡± mean? Roy Romanow and Senator Michael Kirby recommended a 

federal-provincial body much like the recently created National Health Council.
[D] The problem is simple and stark: health-care costs have been, are, and will continue 

to increase faster than government revenues.
[E] According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information, prescription drug costs 

have risen since 1997 at twice the rate of overall health-care spending. Part of the 

increase comes from drugs being used to replace other kinds of treatments. Part of it 

arises from new drugs costing more than older kinds. Part of it is higher prices.
[F] So, if the provinces want to run the health-care show, they should prove they can run 

it, starting with an interprovincial health list that would end duplication, save 

administrative costs, prevent one province from being played off against another, and 

bargain for better drug prices.
[G] Of course, the pharmaceutical companies will scream. They like divided buyers; they 

can lobby better that way. They can use the threat of removing jobs from one province to 

another. They can hope that, if one province includes a drug on its list, the pressure 

will cause others to include it on theirs. They wouldn¡¯t like a national agency, but 

self-interest would lead them to deal with it.

It is not easy to talk about the role of the mass media in this overwhelmingly significant 

phase in European history. History and news become confused, and one¡¯s impressions tend 

to be a mixture of skepticism and optimism. 46) Television is one of the means by which 

these feelings are created and conveyed -- and perhaps never before has it served so much 

to connect different peoples and nations as in the recent events in Europe. The Europe 

that is now forming cannot be anything other than its peoples, their cultures and national 

identities. With this in mind we can begin to analyze the European television scene. 47) 

In Europe, as elsewhere, multi-media groups have been increasingly successful: groups 

which bring together television, radio, newspapers, magazines and publishing houses that 

work in relation to one another. One Italian example would be the Berlusconi group, while 

abroad Maxwell and Murdoch come to mind.
Clearly, only the biggest and most flexible television companies are going to be able to 

compete in such a rich and hotly-contested market. 48) This alone demonstrates that the 

television business is not an easy world to survive in, a fact underlined by statistics 

that show that out of eighty European television networks, no less than 50% took a loss in 

1989.
Moreover, the integration of the European community will oblige television companies to 

cooperate more closely in terms of both production and distribution.
49) Creating a ¡°European identity¡± that respects the different cultures and traditions 

which go to make up the connecting fabric of the Old Continent is no easy task and demands 

a strategic choice -- that of producing programs in Europe for Europe. This entails 

reducing our dependence on the North American market, whose programs relate to experiences 

and cultural traditions which are different from our own.
In order to achieve these objectives, we must concentrate more on co-productions, the 

exchange of news, documentary services and training. This also involves the agreements 

between European countries for the creation of a European bank for Television Production 

which, on the model of the European Investments Bank, will handle the finances necessary 

for production costs. 50) In dealing with a challenge on such a scale, it is no 

exaggeration to say ¡°United we stand, divided we fall¡± -- and if I had to choose a 

slogan it would be ¡°Unity in our diversity.¡± A unity of objectives that nonetheless 

respect the varied peculiarities of each country.

A Helpless Father
The picture ironically shows that a pitiable old man in rags is being helplessly kicked 

off by his three sons and a daughter, who all wear decent clothes. The father¡¯s negligent 

children are all guarding their home gates lest their old father ¡°roll into¡± their 

households. In other words, they four ignore their moral sense of assuming the 

responsibility for their old father even though they may be all living a satisfying life. 

That is a painful scene we often encounter in our daily life.
Sad to say, the moral decline of the younger generations may be a rather explosive 

situation in our modern society. People definitely have their living conditions improved 

by wider and wider margins, as evidenced by the four children¡¯s decent dressing, but 

their moral sense still remains sadly unchanged or in some cases becomes dramatically 

downgrading. Most people might have become too much self-centered, and even worse, they 

discard the tradition of giving respect to the elderly. They no longer care for their 

elders, let alone their neighbors or the disadvantaged; instead they try every means to 

avoid responsibility for other citizens. When one cares for others, one might even appear 

stupid or may even be distrusted.
Therefore, we have to take some useful measures to avoid the scene that is mentioned 

above. We must launch a variety of campaigns about the return to the good tradition of 

giving help and love to the elderly. Moreover, we must appeal to our government to 

establish some relevant laws to punish those who avoid their duties. The last but not the 

least, our respect for age is an indication of the progress of human society, as 

imperatives of traditions require. We sincerely wish that the old man could be welcome to 

any of the four households, elegantly dressed, and a smile on the face.
